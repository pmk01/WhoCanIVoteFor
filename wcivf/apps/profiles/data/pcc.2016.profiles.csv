UK Independence Party (UKIP),Victoria Carolyn Ayling,https://www.choosemypcc.org.uk/candidates/lincolnshire/733/,https://1rbena1k2rviaenzl3kexmgl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Victoria-Ayling.jpg,"As a Lincolnshire County Councillor I meet residents all the time to listen to
their concerns. I believe living among the people I represent is essential to
do a good job.

I began my working life as a Barrister then had a business career. My adult
sons were educated in Lincolnshire and my teenage son is at school in
Horncastle. Now as a mother and local Councillor I have a real interest in
ensuring the best possible policing for everyone in Lincolnshire.

The police should not be politicised and should be independent-minded. Your
Police and Crime Commissioner needs to be answerable to the residents and not
some establishment political hierarchy. I can offer you this with UKIP as I
can work for you without fear or favour from anyone while still being part of
a strong lobbying force to get Lincolnshire a better financial deal. Policing
cannot be done on the cheap, and while volunteers offer a lot to our force,
they cannot plug the gaps left by lack of funding for full time Officers and
PCSOs.

I believe that there should be zero tolerance to crime and anti-social
behaviour. Crime is not a lifestyle option. People should feel safe and be
safe, and visible policing is the way to do this. Nothing can replace
uniformed presence on the beat with better use of PCSOs. All crime should be
recorded and reporting of crime made easier to build trust and confidence in
our policing.

If I am elected I will meet regularly with residents and ensure the Chief
Constable is held to account, bringing as much transparency and accountability
to the office as possible.

The Conservative Party Candidate,Marc Stuart Jones,https://www.choosemypcc.org.uk/candidates/lincolnshire/marc-stuart-jones/,https://1rbena1k2rviaenzl3kexmgl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Marc-Jones.jpg,"As a born and bred Lincolnshire man who is dedicated to local public service,
I feel strongly that Lincolnshire deserves a competent and capable Police and
Crime Commissioner.

I have worked in business for a number of years and am also an Executive
County Councillor currently overseeing a £1 billion budget which includes fire
and rescue services, highways, children's services and adult care.

Setting and balancing the budget is a vital task for our Police and Crime
Commissioner. I understand the need to spend public money wisely and to drive
out inefficiency rather than cut front line services.

On *Thursday 5th May* I hope you will back *my 6 point plan for policing
and crime in Lincolnshire:

• *Introduce 'community constables'* to boost visible neighbourhood policing
by recruiting local people with powers of arrest to work at the heart of our
communities.

• *Focus on crime prevention* by spotting the warning signs of potential
issues in our communities early to reduce the number of victims of crime and
the fear of crime.

• *Deal with rural crime seriously* so that issues such as hare coursing,
theft of livestock, machinery, tools, vehicles and stock do not damage our
local economy and put local jobs at risk.

• *Clean up our streets* with a tough approach to street drinking, fly-
tipping, litter and excess noise which are a blight on our towns and
communities.

• *Treat victims of crime compassionately* with better support and effective
aftercare. Being a victim of crime is bad enough without feeling used by the
system.

•* Spend taxpayers' money wisely* leaving more for front line policing. Over
£165,000 was wasted on the unnecessary suspension of Lincolnshire's Chief
Constable in 2013.

I've lived in Lincolnshire all my life, working
full-time in teaching for fourteen years including in school management for
the past nine. Through my job I understand the need to deliver high standards
efficiently and effectively. I know the importance of setting out a clear
vision for what I wish to achieve and carefullly monitoring progress towards
carefully defined strategic objectives.

I'm committed to neighbourhood policing and preventing anti-social behaviour
so that people feel safe on the streets. I'm determined to tackle rural crime
- we deserve effective policing whether we live in a town, a village or on a
farm. Protecting the most vulnerable in our society, including older people,
children and victims of domestic abuse, is also vital. Working with children
has shown me that one of the best ways to cut crime is to stop crime happening
in the first place which is why I'll be developing further links between
schools and the police to support children making the right choices.

Protecting frontline policing, including PCSOs, is vital. We need to cut
crime, not police. I'll halt any further privatisation of police services, so
we're not putting even more of Lincolnshire taxpayers' hard-earned money into
the hands of big corporations. The force needs more resources, not fewer, so
I'll be fighting for a fairer funding formula.   With the increase in cyber
crime and online fraud we need a police force that's able to tackle 21st
century challenges. Above all, people need to feel safe and secure in their
homes and on the streets where they live and that is what I'll be focused on.

command of the Royal Naval and Royal Marines Reserves completed in 2013. He
has deployed on operational tours in submarines and on land in both the 1991

Relations at Cambridge University in 2004, he served as a diplomat in the
British Embassy Tokyo from 2007 - 2010, where he worked with UK and Japanese
Ministers to secure high-level security co-operation between the two

Determined to bring Labour values to the role of Police Commissioner as in his
military career, he emphasises the need for fairness, honesty and teamwork in
the strategic leadership of policing. His priorities are to continue the fight
for proper funding, to restore effective local policing, and to ensure that
the Police and his own staff are truly engaged with the people of Devon,
Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.

After discussing with people throughout the region their concerns about
policing he commented *""There is a clear need to restore effective local-
based policing, focused on crime risks that are changing rapidly and that vary
from place to place. I am determined to modernise the police workforce and
introduce new technology to ensure an ongoing visible presence, and provide
the skills to address the complex challenges of today's and tomorrow's crime.
Domestic abuse, sexual and other violent crimes, child sexual exploitation and
rapidly increasing and worrying internet based crime are doing so much harm to
our society. The most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society must get their
fair share of policing"".

surrounding areas since 1977.

which, on my watch, our Police Force will deliver law and order through
protecting the vulnerable and supporting the values we cherish through:

  * Targeted Zero Tolerance in areas with increasing levels of violence.
  * Community Payback to reduce pressure on the criminal justice system.
  * Greater priority to wildlife and farm crime.
  * Drunk Tanks.
  * Youth Detox.
  * More random vehicle spot checks.
  * Enhanced community engagement.

We have a precious safe haven in Devon and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.
However, levels of violent crime resulting in injury buck the trend and are
increasing, as do levels of rape and family abuse, often alcohol related. On
my watch, these levels will be reversed.

We will deliver the best for the South West. There will be no further police
station closures and counter services will be restored by training more
special constables.

Can this level of policing be sustained in an era of wanton cuts? Yes it can
with sufficient vision, energy and vigilance.

As a practicing Christian, I believe in a world in which we each place an
equal value on one another, gay or straight, black or white, those of all
religions and those of none. Above all else I believe in respect for each
other and respect for the precious environment we hold dear.

service in the South West. He remained as a Police Constable, working at the
coal face, was commended for outstanding Police Service and has experienced
the damage and pain caused by Government meddling .

He is not a politician nor has he ever been one, he is one of the people and
believes passionately in an independent but accountable Police Service, free
from political interference. He is not new to fighting to save our Unique
British Bobby having attended Parliament on numerous occasions to highlight
this cause.

The imposition of the Police and Crime Commissioner provides the opportunity
for politicians to direct Police Forces according to their own doctrine at the
expense of Community priorities. The Office of The Police and Crime
Commissioner will cost the Devon and Cornwall tax payer millions of pounds
over the next four years.  This money would be far better spent on the Police
Service instead of that extra level of bureaucracy it provides at the moment.

The job description of the Police and Crime Commissioner reflects that of the
French Mayor.  Do we really want a Europol governed political police service?

That is why Jonathan wants to expose the gross misuse of public funds
associated with this role and lobby for its dissolution.

He wants to reverse the policy of withdrawing police visibility from the
community, review station closures and overhaul the 101 telephone system.  He
wants to listen to your opinions, ensure ALL crimes are recorded and
prioritise local issues instead of Government performance targets.  We can
still stop the destruction of what was the best police force in the world, but
we MUST act now.

UK Policing. His extensive range of both operational and strategic management
took him to the heart of sensitive enquiries in the UK, Europe and USA.  With
command of over 3,000 Police officers and staff, he has successfully managed
multi-million pound budgets, delivering efficiency savings whilst improving
performance.

Exceptionally calm under pressure, amongst many high-profile major incidents
he commanded was the response to the Exeter Giraffe Restaurant terrorist
bombing and its aftermath, receiving extremely favourable feedback from the
Home Secretary.

Bob has served in large urban Policing environments, commanding response to
gangland murders and shootings and, in rural communities, such diverse issues
as the Foot-and-Mouth Disease outbreak in Devon and the aftermath of several
terrorist activities across Devon and Cornwall.

Since leaving the Police as Acting Assistant Chief Constable 7 years ago, he
has broadened his experience advising Government and blue-chip companies on
crisis management and leadership. For nearly five years he was also a member
of Devon's Magistracy.  With a strong understanding of partner agencies and
most importantly victims of crime, he has acted as independent chair of both
Devon and Torbay's Safeguarding Boards, tasks including child sexual
exploitation and vulnerable adult safeguarding.

No stranger to tough decisions, Bob has dismissed senior executives who have
failed to perform. He will actively listen to the community to ensure policing
meets their crime prevention and policing needs.  Critically he has the skills
and experience needed to challenge the Devon and Cornwall police to ensure
they deliver for the people of Devon, Cornwall, Torbay, Plymouth and Isles of
Scilly.

As an Independent, Bob would be free to act and free to speak on your behalf
without political pressure.

the new Police and Crime Commissioner.

Richard is an experienced campaigner and as Commissioner he will make the
strongest case for Devon and Cornwall. His knowledge of Whitehall and how
Westminster works is going to be vital to our securing the fair funding deal
that our police force needs.

Richard has three main priorities:

  * To secure a fair funding deal for the Devon and Cornwall Police Force.
  * To maintain and improve the visibility of our police force and improve the 101 service.
  * To protect the Force from a forced merger with Somerset and Avon which would only make decision making more remote.

His knowledge of the scrutiny process from the Defence Select committee gives
him the skills to hold the Chief Constable to account.

He will be a truly independently minded Commissioner.

Richard will also press Government to abolish the post of Police and Crime
Commissioner.

Richard believes that we need a strong democratic oversight of the Police,
that listens to communities and gives them a greater say in how our streets
are policed. We do not need that power given to a single person nor can we
have the Police policing themselves. We need a strong body that can call on
expert advice but is part of the community. This would be better done by
something like the old Police Authority but with the same powers as have been
given to the Police and Crime Commissioner. This will save money and allow
more resources for more police officers.  Richard will work hard and in
partnership with others to achieve this.

Hoddesdon, briefly in Codicote and more recently in Royston.

As an independent member of the Herts Police Joint Audit Committee, I have
gained a very useful insight into what is wrong with policing in the county.

The number of operational police stations has nosedived from 15 down to just
4. Many Hertfordshire residents now find themselves miles from their nearest
police hub. The emergency calls target is to dispatch officers within a three
minute period - currently over 40% fail to meet this target. Hertfordshire has
seen crime such as burglary rise as a result of short sighted decisions which
are to your detriment.

Our greatest resource in tackling crimes is the professionalism of Police
Officers and the dedication of support staff. We need to ensure that this is
not jeopardised for short term political expedience.

  * I will hold the police to account on behalf of the public. I will also hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of the force.
  * I will provide the link between the police and communities working to turn your aspirations, in terms of policing and crime reduction, into action.
  * I will seek to improve policing, deliver community safety and reduce crime, while ensuring value for money.
  * I will set the strategic direction and aims for Herts Police through the Police and Crime Plan.

My key pledges

  * Prioritising the victim and ensuring the offender faces justice.
  * Zero tolerance on crime including anti-social behaviour.
  * A clampdown on bail, for those deemed likely to abscond.
  * More visibility of police on our streets.
  * Crackdown on speeding in villages and residential areas.
  * Overhaul of the police complaints system.

and I am pleased with what has been achieved so far.  In Hertfordshire crime
is low and satisfaction with policing is high. If I am re-elected I intend to
make sure it stays that way.

My focus has been on delivering a top quality service and doing so more
efficiently. By collaborating with neighbouring forces and investing in new
technology, I have met the savings targets set by the Government, cut the
amount that local people pay for policing and maintained a top performing
police force. By improving efficiency I have avoided the cuts seen in other
areas and protected local policing, keeping officers on the frontline. I
believe that protecting neighbourhood policing is vital not just because it is
effective in cutting crime but also because it's the style of policing which
people in Hertfordshire have told me they prefer.

I have put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. The Beacon
Victim Care Centre is funded by money raised from offenders through the courts
and has provided support to thousands of victims of crime. Sadly it remains
the case that many victims are let down by their experience of other parts of
the criminal justice system including the courts and this is something I am
determined to tackle.

I am excited at the opportunities PCCs are being given to make sure all of our
emergency services work more closely together to provide a better service to
the public. I have played a leading role in the national debate on improving
Bluelight collaboration and it is something I intend to take forward if re-
elected as PCC in Hertfordshire.

Chris says: 'It is important that policing remains local - that while we work
with other forces, it remains a Hertfordshire force focussed on Hertfordshire
issues.'

Chris's other key priorities:

  * Make sure there are adequate resources for tackling crimes against women and girls: domestic crimes are systematically underreported and it is time to take them much more seriously.
  * Bear down on costs and ensure greater efficiency: freeing up the police to spend less time behind computers and more time on the streets.
  * Ensure that Hertfordshire's night time economy prospers as a safe environment for visitors: too often our high streets are intimidating for local people and those on a quiet night out.
  * Work more closely with local authorities to ensure that roads are safer.
  * Make sure that there is adequate funding for the police, rather than meaningless tax cuts that the service can ill afford.
  * Open up decision-making so that the public can more fully participate in and challenge the Commissioner's priorities.

With your support on May 5th I'll make sure we have an effective, well-funded
police force that will help keep you and your family safe.

Commissioner, I have worked closely with local residents, councillors,
businesses and the voluntary sector to address your policing priorities.

I've worked hard to ensure that tackling Anti-social Behaviour remains high on
the policing agenda.   Across Northumbria, police officers and partner
organisations work to ensure the minority who cause problems know their
behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.   Our work tackling ASB
has been recognised by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary as being
outstanding.   I have also ensured that Northumbria leads the way in tackling
domestic abuse and violence.   A regional strategy has been implemented and
police officers are better trained to offer support and advice to victims.

Neighbourhood policing is your and my number one priority, so I've brought
police officers closer to you.   Police stations have been relocated to
community hubs, making police officers more accessible.   All savings have
been reinvested in policing.

I will always ensure that victims of crime remain at the heart of everything
we do, and that they get the support they need.   I'm proud that we are
getting it right: we have a satisfaction rate of 91%, the highest in the
country - but I want this figure even higher.

Since 2010, successive Governments have cut more than £100 million from the
Northumbria Police budget.   Despite this challenge, I will continue to ensure
that your priorities are delivered by Northumbria Police.

Northumbria deserves the very best policing.   I have always tried to deliver
this, and if re-elected I will continue to ensure effective policing is
delivered for you and your family.   I hope I can count on your support.

Engaging with the public which so far through surveys and face to face exchanges has confirmed his priority of frontline visible police presence is what the public want putting him in perfect harmony with constituents.

Embracing diversity not treating people the same but in accordance with their individual needs.

Generating an atmosphere of respect between the police and public.

Introduce innovation putting Northumbria Police at the forefront of policing.

Create bespoke policing plan(s) catering for the differences between rural, town and city centre policing issues.

UKIP PCC I would deliver this by representing those who elected me through a
positive united approach in delivering my responsibilities by ensuring
Northumbria Police are open and honest in their actions and accountable to
you. I am lucky enough to represent a party that will not pressure me into
political decisions; I will make decisions that are right for our communities
not the politicians.

I also have a sound working knowledge of enforcement legislative requirements
and constraints in executing duties as well as experience of leading people
and managing budgets, having previously worked in intelligence and enforcement
as the manager of the National Identity Fraud Unit, then as the manager of a
region-wide North East organised fraud team. I understand the competing
priorities and demands encountered when trying to deliver government targets
against a backdrop of budget reductions and staffing issues.

I would like to see more done for victims of sexual abuse, assault or
exploitation, such as more accessible services for both children and adults to
be able to report incidents through. I believe there's a need for this type of
service and that it could be developed and led by Northumbria Police Force
working in conjunction with local authorities and other agencies to make this
type of crime as easy to report as house burglary or common assault.

A vote for another party is a vote for more of the same party politics - but I
believe it's time for change and the only party that promises change is the UK
Independence Party.

Police officers have a tough job and they need more support. The recent
increase in council tax collected by the Northumbria Force must be spent on
front line policing not bureaucracy.

I want to *abolish the PCCs*. They have been an expensive failed experiment.
I'd rather have money spent on police officers than politicians and their
offices.

The police are too often tied up in red tape. We need to free them from too
much time stuck behind desks to spend more time on the streets.

I'll also make sure we do more to *stop re-offending*. I will focus on
rehabilitation and restorative justice so offenders pay back to victims and
the local community. This would *cut crime, save police time and taxpayers'
money.

Finally, more needs to be done to stop people becoming criminals. We should
identify and support at-risk teenagers and young adults before they fall into
a life of crime.

I gave up paid employment 7 years ago to set up my own business and live the
""good life"" - growing my own food. This has given me a good insight into rural
issues.

I am an experienced councillor, representing a partly rural, partly suburban
area on Gateshead Council, which itself covers a mainly urban area. *My
experience gives me a good understanding of the different issues affecting
Tyne and Wear and Northumberland.

I'll use that experience to ensure we're doing all we can to tackle the causes
of crime.

With your support I'll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police
force that will help keep you and your family safe.

The Home Office states PCCs… *""must… take into account the need to: protect
the UK border, critical infrastructure, civil nuclear sites, transport
systems, and the public."" *This is a serious role that requires an
experienced person with the background, maturity and character to coordinate
and lead the work of many organisations; to create one team and one set of
goals to deliver public safety and security.

I am a *former army officer, a former police officer and have held a number
of senior policing, border security and diplomatic posts* which you can read
about at _www.henrybolton.org_. I have used my experience to improve security
in a number of countries, including the US and Russia, and was made an OBE for
services to international security.

As Kent PCC I will:

  * introduce Parish Constables with full police powers;
  * reduce road deaths;
  * strengthen the fight against terrorism, organised crime, cyber-crime, domestic and gender based violence;
  * strengthen border security;
  * reduce anti-social behaviour and create a support centre for those whose lives are blighted by it;
  * maintain present levels of support to victims of crime and sexual assaults;
  * work with local authorities and care providers to strengthen mental healthcare support to people at risk before there's a need for the police to get involved;
  * apply pressure to bring comprehensive planning and transparency to Operation STACK;
  * Reduce unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles to joining the police;
  * oppose privatisation of law enforcement;
  * *hold the government to account for the impact centrally imposed cuts have on the ability of the police to keep the people of Kent safe.

be no party politics in policing.  It is important to be relentlessly tough on
those who adopt criminal lifestyles and I will support Kent Police and
partners to ensure they have the necessary resources to make this a reality.

I am the County Chair of the Kent Police Independent Advisory Group, Vice
Chair of the Kent Police and Crime Panel and a member of the Kent Youth
Justice Board.  I have scrutinised the work of Kent Police for 17 years
representing the issues and concerns raised by members of the public, acting
as a community advocate - something which is integral to this role.

We live in challenging times with national and international issues such as
the counter terrorism threat, Operation Stack and public order disturbances
having a direct impact on us and the work of Kent Police. It is essential the
Commissioner represents the views and challenges our residents face and to
also ensure Kent Police deliver on their mission of providing a first class
service protecting and serving the people of Kent.



My priorities are to:

  * Invest in Policing by putting extra officers in frontline services on the streets of Kent and to make smarter use of technology and training
  * Keeping Our Communities Safe
  * Local Solutions for Local Communities
  * Supporting local businesses by giving Kent Police the resources and technology required to tackle cyber-crime, theft and fraud effectively
  * Tackling Rural Crime
  * Create a volunteer Police Cadet programme for young people of Kent and increase the number of specials and expand the scope of their work and visibility

My six point plan will deliver the positive
changes that Kent and Medway needs in all of our urban, rural and coastal
areas.

The job of a PCC is to make sure people's priorities for policing in their
area are listened to, taken seriously, and acted upon by the Police.
Throughout my career in public service, I have developed the experience
required to support people through the Police and justice system, hold
Ministers and public officials to account and make decisions about how
resources are allocated. Coming from a Police family, I understand not only
what Officers need to get the job done, but what they go through in the line
of duty to protect us all.

As Commissioner, I will work hard to cut crime and reduce re-offending in all
parts of the county. I want to make sure that victims are at the heart of the
justice system and get the support they need. I shall look at how we can
deliver a better service and value for money by developing the relationship
with other emergency services.

I want to increase visible policing on our streets and support neighbourhood
teams. Action is required to tackle the harm caused by anti-social behaviour,
abuse and violence and substance misuse. I shall work with communities on
solutions to the misery caused by Operation Stack. I will promote better
online security to prevent cyber crime. I also want to revolutionise the
approach to mental health, which is taking up more Police time.

For a safer community, lower crime and better accountability, I hope you will
vote for me to be your Police and Crime Commissioner on Thursday 5th May.

""I am English, I was born in England, and support England in sport.

I want an English Parliament the same as the Scottish Parliament, I want to
celebrate St George's Day, like the Irish the celebrate St Patrick's Day, I
want to preserve my English Culture, like the Welsh preserve their language.

I simply want, what other people do for their own Nations, but I am told I
must be British not English, and that if I say I am English &amp; Proud, I am
a racist … why is this ?""

Note:

This is a reduce version of the Steve Uncles Election Address for the 2016
Kent Police Commissioner Elections, the original version can be found on his
website

www.SteveUnclesEnglishDemocrats.org

Steve is prepared to stand up for what is right, he vividly demonstrated this
in 2013 by rugby tackling an armed robber in London, resulting in the robber
being caught when he might have got away, he was subsequently awarded a
Commendation for Bravery by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.

Steve is a consultant project manager, with a huge experience of working in
the public sector and therefore has the ideal qualifications and experience to
lead and mange Kent's Police far more effectively than has happened to date.

Steve has some new ideas that will make a big difference in ensuring that Law
Abiding citizens are protected from Criminals, and in assisting in the proper
enforcement of England's Border Control in Kent, that fall within Kent
Police's jurisdiction.

The English Democrats have a range of Common Sense policies which if
implemented would re-focus Police in Kent on traditional English Law &amp;
Order to Protect us all.

knowledge and experience to do the job in a sensible, inclusive and innovative
manner for the benefit of all those who live in Leicester, Leicestershire and
Rutland.

I have lived in the City and County for over 40 years. I spent 25 years as a
Criminal Law Barrister in Leicester working alongside the Police. I have been
a Government Justice Minister and, recently, Shadow Attorney General sitting
in the Shadow Cabinet. My entire career in Criminal Justice has taught me how
to approach this important responsibility.

Efficient use of public money is vital, but the almost 20% of Central
Government cuts to the Leicestershire Force, including a reduction of over 400
Police Officers, has been too great. In spite of valiant efforts by all
concerned, such a large drop is bound to have resulted in some significant
lessening in the Force's ability to police this diverse area as it would wish.
From the many conversations I have had, it is clear that the Public senses a
lesser emphasis on Community and Neighbourhood policing. This would be my
first priority. Only by working closely with the Community can the Police give
that feeling of protection and security which is at the heart of best
policing.

There is too much ""Hidden Crime"", such as Domestic Violence, Hate Crime and
Cyber Crime, which goes unreported, with victims receiving no redress. This
would be a priority for me, as would Anti-Social Behaviour, something which
adversely affects so many people's lives.

The PCC's role is to look after Public Interest, but can only do so if he/she
always remains close to the many communities that make up our Policing Area.

effective, visible and efficient police force that has the confidence and
trust of us all.

I have lived in South Leicestershire for 24 years with my wife and two
daughters. I qualified as a solicitor and have worked with the Crown
Prosecution Service for over 20 years both as a District Crown Prosecutor and
as a Crown Advocate. I worked closely with the police on many major
investigations and remained independent, objective and fair. I bring
substantial experience and knowledge in working with the police to make our
communities safer.

As a District Councillor I know the benefits of working in partnership in
order to achieve results. I look forward to building on partnerships with
local authorities, health care providers, social services, community groups
and the other emergency services to commission work to prevent offending. I
will also support victims of crime and work hard to give them a greater say.

There are many threats to our safety and my task is to ensure the police are
properly funded to protect us. I am determined to ensure the best value for
money in our Police Force while investing in technology and sharing services
and buildings with other emergency services. Savings made can then be used to
maintain frontline policing.

As your Police and Crime Commissioner I will be accountable to you and will
consult regularly with all communities to ensure your voice is heard by the
police.

Every crime is important no matter where you live and the police should
respond accordingly.

Your priorities for a safe and secure Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland
are my priorities.

The most common complaint I hear about the police is how *we don't see them
as much as we used to. *Tory cuts to police numbers mean that they now focus
on the most serious crimes, leaving less time to patrol locally.

People rightly expect the police to respond to low level crimes too.
Vandalism, graffiti, speeding traffic and inconsiderate parking can make
people's lives a misery. I will ensure the Police give these crimes
appropriate attention too.

The current Police and Crime Commissioner's office costs a staggering* £1
million a year. *I will slash these* costs* and *put the money directly
into frontline policing.

I want to *revolutionise neighbourhood watch.* By getting volunteers trained
and organised they can be visible and collect vital intelligence which the
police can use to prosecute criminals.

All emergency services* and local authorities *should be working together* to *tackle the social and mental health problems* that drive much criminal behaviour.

As a local Councillor for over 14 years and vice chair of the former Police Authority, *I have the experience and knowledge to do the job.

My main priorities will be:

  * *Get back to basics of policing*. By ensuring a more visible police presence on our streets I will work to stamp out the low level crimes that cause daily misery in many of our communities.
  * Revolutionise Neighbourhood Watch to make it more effective in tackling crime.
  * Working with other organisations to *tackle the causes of crime*.
  * *Slash the cost* of the Police and Crime Commissioner's office.

With your support I'll work for a police force that will help keep you and
your family safe.

David is recognised for setting strategy and delivering significant savings
while protecting front line services. He has previously worked with the police
and helped launch the innovative 'Keep Safe Cards' designed for vulnerable
people across the force area. This project highlighted the need to work
jointly across agencies with people with mental health needs.

David believes experience shows that the best form of reassurance policing is
having beat teams as part of the community - having boots on the ground helps
tackle anti-social behavior and persistent offending. The Leicestershire
police force, like other police forces across the country, has seen its
Government grant slashed leaving them with a challenging budget. We need to
look at innovative ways to save money while protecting front line services.
Quickly moving forward on sharing services with other forces across the East
Midlands is one way we could do this. After all, criminals do not recognise
county borders.

David is committed to bring back policing to the community, to serve the
community and work on behalf of the community. David will guarantee
transparency and scrutiny through accountability and performance reporting of
the police in compliance with the agreed Local Police &amp; Crime Plan.

the National Assembly includes over three years as a member of the Welsh
Government. First as the Deputy Minister for Skills and Technology and then as
the Minister for Communities and Tackling Poverty.

Policing must be viewed as a public service based on our key principles of
fairness and social justice. My priorities for policing in Gwent are:

  * A visible presence on our streets and communities. I know that the type of crime that blights our communities more than any other is anti-social behaviour in all its forms.
  * Ensuring that crimes such as domestic abuse, hate crime, child exploitation, and modern slavery are given the attention that they deserve.
  * Developing and maintaining good community cohesion. This is especially important for vulnerable sections of our communities.
  * Working with the Voluntary Sector so that their expertise in a range of areas (e.g. mental health and homelessness) can help inform on-going policies and practices.
  * Working with the Chief Constable so that our principles of social justice become the cornerstone of police practice.
  * Working with the Welsh Government and the devolved public services and on practical issues of support such as the provision of the additional Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) for Gwent.
  * Playing its part in counter terrorism activities.

All of this must be worked for in the face of cuts to the police budget, by
the Tory UK Government, over the last five years.

This will demand strong partnerships with Education, Social Services, the NHS,
and other key providers of public services.

I believe that I have the experience and commitment to make policing reflect
our values of social justice.

  * Protecting the number of frontline police
  * Cutting crime and ensuring our streets are safe
  * Ensuring officers spend more time on the beat
  * Defending victims and putting their needs first
  * Tackling cyber-crime and keeping people safe online

The Police and Crime Commissioner role is important. It matters who does it,
and you have a clear choice.

Vote for me, Matthew Grove, and back the work done so far to make our area
safer. I'll continue to be visible, to listen and demonstrate that by working
with the Government I can continue to deliver lower crime for every community
across East Yorkshire, Northern Lincolnshire and the City of Hull.

It's outrageous that the post of Police Commissioner is paid more than the
Leaders of Hull and East Riding Councils put together. *I'll set up a
dedicated fund of £25,000 a year to support victims of crime *instead.

That's not the only way I'll lead by example in tough times. *I will not
appoint any political 'deputy commissioners' paid for by taxpayers*. That
money should be spent on policing.

Covering such a large area, it's easy for a Police and Crime Commissioner to
become remote and out of touch.

I want to be a new kind of Commissioner - listening and available to local
residents. *I will hold an open surgery in every city, town and parish each
year.

My top priority will be front-line policing in local communities. Humberside
Police moved away from that model last year, and it hasn't worked. The recent
inspection report showed community police officers were worried they couldn't
do their jobs properly. That has to change.

I have lived and worked in the Humberside Police area for over 25 years. I am
an experienced manager, with a long career in local business and
manufacturing. I've supported local manufacturing companies and helped their
apprentices and engineers improve their skills.

So I know what it's like to lead a big organisation, and to get the best from
the people who work for it. *I have the skills and experience necessary to
lead a large organisation and do it well.

Above all, my fight isn't against any of the other candidates - it's to make our area safer, for all of us who live here.

strongly qualifies him for the role of Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC).
Keith had a 30 year police career, working on both banks of the Humber,
starting on the beat and concluding as a senior officer with national
recognition for his strategic leadership, management and business planning
skills. His strong and principled leadership, putting communities first, led
to huge reductions in crime, innovations in delivering efficiencies and
excellent partnership working contributing to the best public confidence
ratings in the region. This success led to Keith being headhunted as part of a
small national team tasked with improving underperforming police forces.

Since leaving the Police, Keith has built a new career as a leadership,
management and criminal justice expert. He is trusted by the Foreign Office to
support their work overseas acting as a strategic adviser leading teams of
international experts improving justice agencies.

Keith now wants to put all his experience to work for the communities of the
Humberside Police area again, not reliving his operational days but using the
insights gained during many years of success to create a new relationship
between the police and the public, a real partnership.

He will:

  * Prioritise community policing, making it the heart of policing delivery
  * Pass more control to communities so they can direct what their officers deal with
  * Get PCC staff out on to the ground to check the reality of police delivery so no communities get left behind
  * Clearly speak up for the public, challenging police failures but also cuts to officer numbers
  * Involve police officers and staff meaningfully in building a force that responds to communities
  * Rebuild trust, confidence, effectiveness and morale.

served on its Project Board which oversaw the construction of two multi-

ensure that these were delivered on time and on budget. As Chair of a charity
I helped to develop a business plan to act on behalf of the public on issues
of health and social care and set up a professional monitoring and audit
process.

Cuts in Police funding mean that there may be even fewer staff and that
response times could deteriorate. Labour will keep our police visible and
offer you real power over what policing priorities should be. The role of the
PCC puts too much power in the hands of one individual so I believe the job
should be done completely differently. We must put communities at the heart of
the fight against crime and give people a direct say in how to spend the
resources which are continually being reduced by this Government.

The role of PCC must support those who are victims of crime as well as those
at risk of offending. Supporting crime prevention measures is vital. I will
oppose any suggestion of expanding the role to include the Fire &amp; Rescue
Service and am also opposed to having to having a paid deputy.

I will make the PCC more accountable and ensure that everyone gets their voice
heard.

I have spent my working life dedicated to ensuring the security of our
country. I believe that public safety and the rule of law are the bedrock
foundations for positive, open and successful societies and communities. I see
the appointment of PCC as an opportunity to put something back and help
Dorset, where I live, face existing and developing criminal and other
challenges to public safety.

I have worked closely with the Police, in particular for two years supporting
the ACC South Region in Northern Ireland after the Good Friday Agreement. I
admire what they do.

Having been burgled I understand the sense of intrusion, hurt and insecurity
crime leaves behind. Crime blights lives. I also recognise that the Police
cannot do everything on their own and the public has a part to play. A
drumbeat theme of my tenure as PCC would be 'Policing at the heart of our
communities' - not 'Them' and 'Us' but *'WE'*.

Dorset spends more than £120 million of taxpayers' money each year on
policing. I have held sizable public budgets (£100m - £1.2bn), delivered
significant results and identified smart ways of shifting the costs of support
and office functions towards the sharp end.

Since leaving the Army I have broadened my business experience by working in
industry, leading a youth development charity and volunteering with a national
mental health charity.

I have the proven and tested experience, leadership, vision, commitment and
management skills to work with the Chief Constable and the people of Dorset to
make and keep our county a safer place to live and to work and to visit.

A former serviceman, Dorset has been my home for over ten years and I was
elected onto the Shaftesbury Town Council in 2015.

I served in the Royal Navy for 25 years, saw action in the Falklands conflict
of 1982 on board HMS Sheffield and supported the United Nations peace-keeping
efforts in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. My final posting was as the UK
nuclear deterrent operational planning officer.

On leaving the RN I worked as a manager in the NHS before qualifying as a
financial adviser.

The freedom to be independent

Unlike other parties UKIP does not insist that its politicians follow a party
whip. That leaves me free to use my own initiative to act in the best
interests of keeping the people of Dorset safe.

With the power of a political party

But I will have the strength of UKIP behind me to apply pressure when
necessary to help me in my task. Such as arguing for increased government
funding to finance more bobbies on the beat, the jewel in the Crown of British
policing.

A completely fresh perspective

The job of Police and Crime Commissioner is to hold the Chief Constable to
account, not to try and run the police. I am not a former police officer, so I
have no pre-conceived notions about what can and cannot be changed. It is time
to bring new thinking to the table.

I am a graduate of BRNC Dartmouth and the Open University, have a post-
graduate diploma in management studies and am a member of the Chartered
Management Institute.

As a former police officer and your Dorset PCC since 2012, I understand how
policing and the role of the PCC fit together. Dorset is a special place; I
understand the County and its people.

I have overseen the Force through unprecedented cuts and changes in demand.

I have:

  * *Introduced the Victims' Bureau *to help victims in their journey. I have* *commissioned support services for victims.
  * *Improved mental health provision* for people in crisis, improving their care and reducing demand on police. I lead nationally for PCCs in this arena.
  * *Introduced the Strategic Alliance* between Dorset, Devon and Cornwall police, improving efficiency and delivering huge savings.
  * *Worked nationally with Government* on areas such as use of force, taser, fraud and mental health, benefiting Dorset people. I have led the call for a funding review which gives Dorset a fairer deal.
  * *Listened to the public *and interacted with 250,000 people; approximately 35,000 being face to face. I have won national awards for transparency and engagement with communities; each community in Dorset is different.

I will:

Invest* resources to protect Dorset people from emerging threats of:

  * Targeting and abuse of those at risk
  * Cyber crime

Invest *in* *the Marine Unit.

Continue* to talk to local people; to be the interface with their police.

Continue* to represent and support victims.

Improve* accessibility and visibility of your police.

Improve* technology and efficiency.

Establish *a rural crime team.

Appoint *a business crime champion.

Dedicate *resources to keep you safer on Dorset's roads.

Support* Neighbourhood Policing.

The PCC role is about leadership and community engagement. Our Thames Valley
Police give an outstanding service to the community, however, I am acutely

vital that any PCC holds not only the Chief Constable to account but the

increased frontline officers will be essential to delivering a promise to
reduce the fear of crime and crime itself. Tackling business crime and
increasing the efforts on rural crime reduction will be a key priority of mine
too. My dedication and honesty will have a positive impact on our community,
for a safer community.

If elected as your Police &amp; Crime Commissioner, I will stand up as the
straight-talking voice of the people in Thames Valley and I will make sure we

ensure continuity, increased visibility &amp; faith in the Police force. I am
passionate about restoring trust between the community and the police force

the Chief Constable to account should not be motivated by a political or
personal agenda.

My decision to stand is partly driven by the concern I have about the proposed
merger of the Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire County police divisions,
currently widely unopposed and without public consultation.

The challenges facing policing in the city and county are very different. Over
recent years, thanks to excellent partnership working between the police,
local authorities, neighbourhood and community groups, crime in Nottingham and
Nottinghamshire has dropped. This is because in each area there is someone
ultimately accountable for policing. If the merger went ahead, Nottingham
would be the only city of its size not to have a unique police division. No
one wants us to fall behind other cities and return to the dark days over a
decade ago with a reputation for gun crime and binge drinking.

If elected, I will review the salary of the commissioner and staff. The
£75,000 annual commissioner salary would be halved and the £90,000 a year
Chief Executive reviewed as this is unacceptable, especially as public sector
cuts are harming front-line services and front-line policing.

Savings on my salary and current deputy would be spread amongst five deputies,
representing all sections of the community including young people.

Most local people don't know what the role of the commissioner is; I would
communicate far better and give the community a bigger voice.

Vote for me on May 5th and I will fight for Nottinghamshire to have the
policing it deserves.

  * *To improve neighbourhood policing

As a retired senior police officer, he understands how important neighbourhood
policing is to make sure people feel safe in their communities and to act as a
deterrent of crime.

  * *To protect response policing

We should make more use of fire stations, ambulance stations and other public
buildings to provide more local operating bases for response officers. We owe
a more rapid response to the people we serve.

  * *Reduce the fear of crime and support victims of crime

It is imperative that we reduce the 'fear of crime' throughout
Nottinghamshire, even people living in the safest parts of the county can have
their quality of life detrimentally affected by this. We need to improve the
support for victims of crime.

  * *Be more efficient with the money and resources

As a former senior police officer, he knows where savings can be made and re-
invested in neighbourhood and response policing. Everything we do must be
focused on front line policing.

He understands the importance of listening and passing on the views of all
residents of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire. He would be proud to represent
his home county as the Police and Crime Commissioner, making sure
Nottinghamshire Police improves to become one of the best Police Forces in the
country.

I am standing as UKIP's Candidate because I believe that our police force

authorities.

During my career, I have specialised in project management of taking under-
performing businesses, holding senior management to account and turning
organisations around during financial difficulties. Nottinghamshire Police are
in a poor financial position that has led to cuts to the front line and
stations are closing.

I will aim to:

  * Have a zero tolerance to crime, reverse cuts to front line services.
  * Repair the bridge of trust between the people of Nottinghamshire communities and police.
  * Have more visible police, fully versed in common law to ensure people's rights and property are protected.
  * Improve policing and deterrents to boost safety in our City and town centres, especially for the night time economy.
  * Provide a walk-in centre for members of the public and community groups to meet with the PCC team.
  * Introduce community policing, to ensure rural areas have a local face and local point of contact.
  * To prioritise the investigations into child sexual abuse and co-operate fully with the Goddard enquiry coming to Nottingham. This dark shadow has been cast over Nottingham for far too long, the survivors and victims need increased support and justice must be served.

If elected as PCC, I will uphold a 100% commitment to openness and
transparency within the PCC office.

at the top of policing"" says County Councillor Jason Zadrozny.

Jason says his campaign will be about refocusing Nottinghamshire Police Force.
He will root out police corruption, he will demand more front-line officers
and ensure there are no more police station closures.

Jason, formerly a member of the County's Police Authority and former Leader of
Ashfield District Council, is clear that only he has the experience to bring
about the urgent change needed to improve local policing.

At the last set of PCC Elections in 2012, an Independent Candidate came
closest to beating Labour.  Jason said: ""Since I announced my intention to
stand for election, I have been contacted by members of all political parties
with kind words and encouragement.  It is clear that this election will be a
tight race between myself and Labour.""

Nottinghamshire Police have closed police stations, cut officer numbers and
axed services right across our County and City. At the same time, they have
increased spending on expensive spin doctors, increased pen-pushers and hiked
up your council tax. The job of a PCC is to decide police priorities.  At the
moment they seem determined to protect their dwindling authority at the
expense of protecting the people of Nottinghamshire.

Jason would:

  * Scrap Labour's waste on spin doctors.
  * Invest in frontline services.
  * Put more bobbies back on the beat in your area.
  * Not close any more Police Stations.
  * Ensure a fairer distribution of policing resources between the City and County.
  * Make your streets, parks and town centres feel safer.

Supporting Jason would mean real change here this time.

A Police and Crime Commissioner is entrusted by the public to hold the Chief
Constable to account for the delivery of policing. To do this credibly it is
an advantage to have an in depth knowledge and understanding of policing. This
will support their judgement and provide them with the insight to effectively
challenge the Chief Constable on behalf of the public.

In his view the past four years of government cuts, together with poor local
decision making has been a disaster for policing North Yorkshire. It has, in
his opinion, led to the reduced visible presence of police officers, the
inefficient and negligent use of public money and a critical reduction in
public confidence of our police and the role of the PCC.

The reason I am standing is because I care passionately about safeguarding my
county and our police service.

As North Yorkshire's Independent Police and Crime Commissioner I will bring a
local approach to policing priorities and focus on the real issues and

My priorities for policing in Essex are aimed at mending the damaged elements

I understand that Essex Police and Crime Commissioner is a challenging role,
and public safety is important to all Essex's residents. The government has
undertaken to protect police budgets for the rest of this parliament, but the
Police Service will still need to modernise: to be local and accessible, and
use new technologies and media to be more open and efficient. Where this has
been done elsewhere we know they spend a fifth more of their time out on
patrol. And to make sure policing is local, I aim to put a Special Constable
in every community.

My experience as Cabinet Member at Essex County Council and Deputy Leader at
Brentwood Council will enable me to help the Police prioritise and manage
their resources, and lead to more effective and efficient policing in Essex.
Professionally, I have over thirty years' experience as a leading financial
analyst at major British, European and American banks. In doing so I have
successfully led and shaped large organisations who serve millions of people.
Essex Police is different, but I can offer them the same qualities of

help the Police deliver and enable me to hold them to account when they need

violence, domestic abuse and cybercrime. It is short of money to deal with
these issues following decades of underfunding - by Conservatives nationally
and those in Essex who set Police budgets.

Essex's next Police and Crime Commissioner must fix these issues. If elected I
will:

Listen *to the concerns of local communities *and* the victims of crime when setting priorities for Essex.

Tackle *issues that have not been resourced properly, such as the 85 incidents of domestic abuse in Essex every single day.

Work* with councils and other Essex agencies so our limited resources go further, tackling the root causes of crime; and work with partners across UK and EU to share crime information.

I have lived around Essex all my life. I understand the needs of victims and
residents, and the challenges facing Essex Police.

Far too many politicians talk ""tough on crime"", but do things that don't work
- and sometimes makes things worse. A good example is illegal drugs.

The emphasis should be on arresting gangs and dealers that make people's lives
miserable. Some users should be treated as a medical, not criminal, issue.
This could free up police time to deal with more serious crime.

With joined up thinking between police, councils, schools and other agencies
we can stop anti-social behaviour before it becomes criminal, and tackle
underlying causes.

We must tackle re-offending, using methods that have worked elsewhere. Where
victims are willing to meet criminals, this has cut re-offending
significantly. By rehabilitating offenders through reconciliation and
restorative justice, re-offending can be reduced, saving the police and the
courts time and money.

Zero Tolerance Policing ex Chief

  * *Relentlessly pursue more funding for Essex Police
  * *Take a Zero Tolerance approach to policing in Essex
  * *Deliver more visible street policing
  * *Put victims at the centre of the criminal justice system
  * *Give you more opportunities to have your say about policing
  * *Protect your local policing by standing up for Officers and Essex* *Police*.
  * *Ensure you receive the highest possible standard of service from* *Essex Police

My campaign is supported by Mick Thwaites, former Divisional Commander, Head of Mobile Support-Police Operations and Temporary Assistant Chief Constable for Essex Police. Other ex Essex Officers are indicating they will support and work with me so that informed decisions are made.

Having been born, lived and worked most of my life in Essex, an Independent
Councillor for 13 years, coupled with my career in local industry, I know the
County of Essex well. I understand the make-up of the county in its individual
and unique communities, so I will not have a parochial mind set. I am a
strategic thinker and I have the determination to fight for what is right for
all our towns and villages across Essex.

I believe that the hallmark of any civilised society is community safety, with
the cuts imposed by the government and approved by the current PCC Essex
citizens are less safe. Recently published figures show crime is up,
conviction rates are down. In fact I believe the current bad set of numbers
are not accurate, the figures are significantly higher.

Community safety is in my DNA and is under threat; I pledge to defend all of
our communities.

In the last year violent crime in Essex *increased* by 14%, yet since 2010
the amount of Police Officers in the county has *decreased* by over 500,
whilst PCSO numbers have been decimated.

As Labour's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), I will focus on tackling the
increase of violent crime across Essex and in particular the rise in domestic
violence. I'll do this by working to ensure that we have an effective and
efficient police service that is in the heart of communities, to support
victims as well as working to prevent crime.

With my background in Education, I understand how crime can affect communities
and how vital a preventative approach to policing is. However, that isn't just
about education; it's also about visible, frontline policing in local
communities, and building effective partnerships across the public and
voluntary sector. Of course, the Tory cuts in police budgets will make our
task harder, but there is much that can be done to protect those most at risk
of crime.

I also want to help support police officers and police staff, who work hard
under increasingly difficult circumstances. That's why I will work ceaselessly
to protect frontline policing and ensure that our officers and staff are able
to do their jobs to keep the people of our community safe.

The last Labour Government coined a phrase which is as true today as it was
then 'Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime' and that will be my
approach, if elected, as your PCC in May

account and set the police's budget and priorities.

My priorities are -

  * More visible policing in our towns and villages
  * Fighting Conservative government plans to cut police funding
  * Taking domestic violence more seriously
  * Tackling crimes against small businesses and farms
  * Campaigning against court closures

Cumbria police is under threat. *Last year the Conservative government
proposed cutting £21million from its budget.* That's the cost of over 400
front line police officers.

They might have delayed the cuts, but the government still intend to change
the funding formula later this year.

I will fight tooth and nail for a fairer funding deal for Cumbria's police.

As a proven manager, consultant and daughter of a former police officer, I'm
also the right person to hold Cumbria police to account.

I want us to do more to *stop re-offending.

We need restorative justice to support and help victims of crime, and we need
to promote rehabilitation and youth services to help offenders turn their
lives around and reduce re-offending rates.

We need to restore trust in Cumbria police, *tackling anti-social behaviour
and taking strong action on domestic violence and sexual exploitation

And if I'm elected as your PCC, *I'll publish my expenses on the web so you
can see how your money is being spent.

When police budgets are being cut, your PCC needs to lead by example and spend
wisely.  I also want to see a full and transparent recruitment process for all
appointments to the PCC's office, basing all appointments on merit.

With your support on 5th May I'll make sure we have a police force that will
keep Cumbria safe.

PCC. However, we cannot be complacent, Domestic Violence, Cybercrime, Child
Sexual Exploitation are increasing. Terrorism is a constant threat. In Cumbria
we must also prioritise rural crime to safeguard our families, homes, farms
and tourist industries.

I will make these and addressing all forms of anti-social behaviour my
priorities, including securing the future of consistent safe provision for
victims of crime and domestic abuse across Cumbria, I'll introduce a youth
commission to engage young people in preventing crime.

I have served our country on operations as diverse as peacekeeping in Bosnia,
Foot and Mouth here in Cumbria and most recently in Sierra Leone fighting
Ebola. I was Regimental Colonel of The Royal Logistic Corps, 16,000 personnel
supporting Operations in Afghanistan, have had vast commercial experience and
direct responsibility for multi million pound procurement, and operational
budgets.

The army culture is about leadership, teamwork and getting the job done, not
committees talking about it, squabbling or making excuses, I will work with
the police, communities and agencies as a team.

Balancing the books will always be challenging but I have worked at Ministry
level and understand how government works, I will fight to safeguard our
policing budget and front line police numbers, most importantly I will ensure
Cumbria has a voice to government ministers.

Integrity, gaining your trust and doing the right thing are important to me.

Cockermouth Grammar School, and studied Chemical Engineering at Birmingham
University. Then spent my career in the oil industry, UK and abroad, but
always with a base in Cockermouth from where I could enjoy mountaineering,
walking, coastal routes and the other benefits of living in Cumbria.

UKIP is a strong believer in Law and Order and that the Police have a very
important role in a civilised society to protect ordinary people and allowing
us to live our lives peacefully. At the same time there have been instances
across the UK where the Police and connected authorities have needed more
accountability and transparency to ensure that the Police etc. are working in
our overall best interests.

Part of managing safety is crime prevention, which is both steering potential
criminals away from crime, but also assisting existing criminals to change
their lives away from criminal activity. The Commissioner has an important
role to play in facilitating crime prevention initiatives.

The very large and unusual shape of Cumbria Police Area, and the locations of
Police and Crime related bodies, brings many challenges and the Commissioner
needs to be positioned so as to reach everywhere. My home is in Cockermouth,
which fits in well with the road system giving convenient road access across
the whole of the Cumbria Police Area.

A UKIP Commissioner will seek to represent everyone to ensure that we live
peaceful lives, as safe from crime as is possible.

Cumbria Police Commissioner. Prior to the reform of Policing I was Chair of
the Cumbria Police Authority having held the position for 20 years. During
that time we achieved the highest number of police officers, civilian staff,
and recorded the most favourable crime figures ever by Cumbria Police. I was
honoured to receive an OBE for my services to Policing and the People of
Cumbria.

I am putting myself forward at this time of austerity and changes to Policing
and other Blue Light Services to try and reverse the impact of the last four
years on numbers of officers and neighbourhood Policing. I am concerned that
cuts and future proposed cuts by the current Government will impact greatly,
not only on Police moral but public confidence in the Service.

My priorities will be vandalism, disorder, anti-social behaviour but because
of the large geography of Cumbria priorities can differ, what suits Barrow
doesn't suit Carlisle. Priorities can and will differ widely from month to
month from farmland to town and village, and Police organisation needs to
recognise this. Organised crime within the Country especially relating to
child sexual exploitation and internet crime is increasing in the County as is
the reporting of domestic violence. These are areas I will continue to focus
on especially in regard to the training of ALL Police personnel.

believes at a time when the Police are facing huge challenges local and
nationally, the Chief Constable would be best supported and held to account by
an experienced candidate with Labour values rooted in the community.

Barry is a Gloucestershire County Councillor and Deputy Leader of the Labour
Group. He has been involved in a wide range of community activities, including
starting the Kingsway Residents Association, local rugby coaching and
community radio, as well as being a parish councillor. He has campaigned on a
number of issues including leading the campaign against the closing of county
magistrates' courts.

Barry's focus is on:

  * Policing in Partnership - Working with local community organisations
  * Tackling Domestic Violence - Focusing on both physical and psychological abuse
  * Rural Policing - Ensuring that Rural Communities are properly supported
  * Policing Cyberspace - Ensuring we can use the Internet confidently and safely
  * Community Policing - Bringing residents and police closer together

Barry is the Deputy Chair of the Gloucestershire Police and Crime Panel and
has been a Magistrate in Gloucestershire. This experience has given Barry an
understanding of local issues and a wide view of the justice system. Barry
says: ""I want to see the whole justice system work effectively for victims,
witnesses, the police, defendants and the many volunteers involved in the
delivery of justice.""

In his day job, Barry runs a small human science research and technology
company in Gloucester. This provides him with the practical experience of
budgeting, planning and motivating people.

I am standing as an Independent because I believe party politics has no place in policing. I am also standing to continue the work I began in November 2012.

Much progress has been made since then and with your support I hope to build
on it. My aims, therefore, may be familiar.

If I am re-elected, I will prioritise making our police more visible and come
when we need them. I want older people to feel safe and I want a system that
works for young people not against them. Everyone, whatever their age or
background, should feel safe day or night and be able to use our streets and
public places without feeling threatened.

I will introduce new measures aimed at making our roads safer and continue
working with our young people to make them more responsible, better drivers.
The investment in tackling cybercrime, which has put the Constabulary at the
forefront of counteracting criminality on the internet, will also continue.

On my watch, Gloucestershire has become a UK leader in ""Restorative Justice"",
the service where criminals and their victims are brought together. This has
proven benefits for victims and reduces re-offending and I will continue to
support it.

I am the only candidate with experience of being Police and Crime Commissioner
and as an experienced former officer, I am also the only candidate in
Gloucestershire with direct policing experience.

My record shows I kept all the promises I made to you before the last election
and the Constabulary has benefited as a result. Check

efficiency and leadership, which are vital to delivering an effective police
force as your Police and Crime Commissioner.

A PCC must listen and respond to the needs of the local community. In 1999 I
was elected as a Councillor for the Forest of Dean and three years later
became a member of Gloucestershire County Council.

As a Councillor I have undertaken various responsibilities that make me well
suited to a role that requires working with the police as well as overseeing
the budget to ensure taxpayer's money is spent wisely. For the past eight
years I have been the Cabinet Member responsible for running Gloucestershire's
Fire and Rescue Service. With a staff of 400 firefighters and 22 fire
stations, by working together we have reduced our budget by more than 20%,
without undermining frontline services.

I have also led Gloucestershire's Trading Standards and the Coroners service,
carrying out key law enforcement responsibilities, and joined the Chief
Constable on the Road Safety Partnership.

We need someone with experience to deliver smart, strategic savings in the
police as the County Council has done in other areas.

My police plan will focus on 5 key areas:

Keeping the county safe from terrorism.

Preventing crime and anti-social behaviour.

Greater protection for victims of domestic violence.

Better policing for all of Gloucestershire.

Collaboration to save money and improve efficiency.

  * Put Victims First - Victims, and those in fear of crime, need to know that I will put their needs and rights ahead of criminals. This involves working with, and expanding, the excellent front line police that we have, to focus on communities' real needs.
  * Ensure Real Cultural Change - The police need to know that they have a Police and Crime Commissioner who will support their every effort to refocus the organisation's culture away from red tape and back covering and towards serving our neighbourhoods better.
  * Ensure More Resources reach the front line - In addition to cutting red tape, I want to drive cost reductions in back office and administrative areas, explore ways that costs could be shared with neighbouring areas or other emergency services. If elected, I will lobby the Home Secretary for additional resources for South Yorkshire.
  * Bring a Fresh Approach to the Police - I will do this by not shirking from asking the difficult questions about issues that for too long have been swept under the carpet so that today's police force can start to look forward and embed the lessons and cultural change required.

patrolled the streets for many years across Hampshire and knows the problems
that frontline Police Officers face every day.
""I believe that the best way to know about policing needs in Hampshire and the
Isle of Wight is to have served in the Police locally,"" says former PC Richard
Adair.

As Hampshire and Isle of Wight Police Commissioner Richard Adair will have
three clear priorities,
1\. Protecting frontline policing from cuts. If the Government force cuts on
the Police, senior   management not frontline Police Constables should be
reduced.
2\. The public should be able to meet Police Officers when they need them, so
Police Stations need to be maintained.
3\. Mental Health services need real resource from Government so that Police
Officers do not become mental health social workers doing a job they are not
trained for.

Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are a large police area but the common sense
answers to local policing problems are more likely to come from someone who
has been a policeman in the Hampshire Constabulary for over 30 years.

For a Policeman to be in charge of Hampshire Police Force please support the
real expert; former Hampshire Police Officer for 30 years Richard Adair,
Liberal Democrat.

• *Preventing crime* in the first place.
• *Improving frontline Policing.
*• Reducing re-offending.
*• Educating &amp; supporting young people.
*• Supporting Victims and witnesses.
*• Preventing crime against business.
*• Protecting against cyber crime.

I'm again standing as an* Independent, non-Party Political candidate*,
because I believe *YOUR Police Commissioner* must be *free from the
influences of Political masters in Westminster*.
Over the past 3 ½ years, in the face of huge cuts, I've *successfully
delivered* an efficient and effective police service.

By taking a *businesslike approach to all we do*, operational policing is
starting to see benefits. My Estates Strategy has *modernised the
Constabulary*, is saving money while delivering a more efficient and modern
working environment for frontline officers. Investment in technology - Body
Worn Video, mobile communications and working with partners has brought *the
Constabulary to the forefront of modern policing*.

Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary* classed our financial planning for the future as *""outstanding""*, recognised my *commitment to neighbourhood policing*, ensuring *police officers and PCSO's remain on our streets*, engaging with communities - delivering traditional policing in the modern environment. HMIC also noted we are *good at preventing crime, anti-social behaviour and working effectively to reduce reoffending*.

For me, *the role of Police and Crime Commissioner is not just about
governance of the Constabulary*. It is, and importantly, *about co-
ordinating community responsibility to bring about ""social change""*, working
with others to prevent crime, reduce re-offending, support victims and protect
the vulnerable.

If re-elected,* I will build on my successes since 2012* and tackle the new
challenges faced by policing in modern times, with a *focus on young people,
the vulnerable, businesses and early prevention*.

international business lawyer, and specialised in IT Law, founding my firm's
practice in that area in 1983. I have lived in Southampton, Winchester, Fleet
and the Borough of Fareham. I now live in East Hampshire, where I have been a
local Councillor since 2003, and was an Independent Candidate in the Hampshire
PCC election in 2012.

The OPCC is an unnecessary and politicised tier of government and a waste of
public money. Its huge cost would be better spent on local police stations to
ensure local community policing and intelligence to combat terrorism.

The police should be empowered to do their job, with minimum interference. The
OPCC should scrutinise the police, not tell them what to do. It should ensure
that serious complaints about the police are properly and independently
investigated.

The Commissioner should be independent of all major political parties, and
dedicated to ensuring that the law is applied equally to all. No one person
should have these powers. As Commissioner I would act as Chairman of a panel
of unpaid volunteers, as with the old police authority, and without a PR
department.

Priorities, especially terrorism, robbery, drug-related crime, and sexual
exploitation are obvious to the police. So is the rise in cyber-crime, where I
am well-connected and qualified to help. More work is needed to recover the
proceeds of crime, and to ensure that all crimes are recorded and
investigated.

My Promises
• To consult regularly throughout Hampshire to help police officers deliver
what the public wants and needs.
• Not to take a salary and use the funds saved to assist voluntary
organisations for the prevention of crime and protection of victims.

• Tackling domestic abuse, protecting the vulnerable
• Putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system
• Addressing rural crime
• Seeking innovation that increases effectiveness &amp; reduces bureaucracy
• Creating strong partnerships.

increasingly remote Government the effect of cuts to the police service,
involving the loss of 780 officers in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Crime
fell by 43% under the last Labour Government but that record is now under
threat. I am talking to our communities about the problems they face and will
ensure resources are prioritised to deal with them.

The Government is planning to take the fire and rescue service away from local
government and merge it with the police service. This is an attempt to reduce
spending on services. The people who work in the two services do not want
this. We already have cooperation and sharing of premises between the two
services in Hampshire and I oppose this bureaucratic plan.

I have worked as a solicitor most of my life in Hampshire and the Isle of
Wight. I have given free legal advice and worked for Portsmouth City Council.
I ran my own firm of solicitors in Ryde which included criminal and family
work, and have extensive experience of the courts system.

The Government's claim that crime is falling is not true of many types of
crime. Some of my priorities would be:
• Put resources into front line policing for community safety and reducing
anti-social behaviour.
• Ensure officers have the expertise to deal with escalating cybercrime.
• Recognise the high cost of rural crime in Hampshire.
• Helping people with mental health problems takes up much police time. I will
campaign for improved mental health services.
• I oppose increased court charges and the reduction in legal aid and will
investigate their impact.

He has extensive experience as a senior leader and executive with the NHS,
Sodexho Alliance and he has managed two high profile Law firms. Roy came
second in the GE2016 in the New Forest.

Roy's message is simply this: ""In a few years Hampshire has lost, 1000 cops
and 1700 staff, you cannot run a 21st Century police service in this way. This
blinkered approach has seen huge increases in crime and increased danger to
the public. It's time to take back our communities and provide the people of
Hampshire/IOW with a Police Service they want, not what Government think they
need"". Roy will lead a new empowering partnership between the people and the
police, to deliver a new standard in effective policing. Roy will not allow
police to be replaced by civilians with few powers. He wants more police
officers to work the streets, get close to communities again and start making
people feel safe. Intelligence is key in the fight against crime and violence,
the only way to gather that is to get cops closer to the public. The French
and Belgian police are now changing back to this model. Roy promises 100's
more cops, increased road safety, more firearms officers, less wastage and
more transparency, and a more effective and efficient PCC office, which is
value for money. A vote for Roy is a vote for strong empowering leadership and
much needed change.

It is an amazing part of the best
country in the world. The North East has an exciting future and growing
prosperity.

But we can tackle crime better.

In addition to my day job in health care, I run a non-profit organisation
aimed at reducing offending and reoffending. The Centre for Crime Prevention
backs 'broken windows', zero tolerance policing and tougher sentencing for
serious, repeat offenders who plague communities.

I want to bring these insights into local policing. My six point plan for
Darlington and Durham is:

  * *Greater visibility for police

Getting more police out of their offices and cars so they are patrolling a
beat on foot. This lets police really get to know the local community, who the
troublemakers are, and pick up local knowledge.

  * *Slash needless bureaucracy and paperwork

Work with police and use new technology to cut red tape.

  * *Implement 'broken windows', zero tolerance policing

Tackling anti-social behaviour and so-called 'low level' crimes is key to
making local communities safer.

  * *Campaign for much tougher sentences for serious, repeat offenders

Appeal to the Attorney General against lenient sentences and encourage
prosecutors to pursue the toughest charges. Invest in victim support,
assisting victims in making the most persuasive statements before the courts.

  * *Avoid treating the motorist as a cash cow

Speed cameras should be used only to tackle serious speeding - not to get more
revenue from the motorist.

  * *Go on patrol with local police at least one day per week

… and publish all expenses online.

I will be the public's representative to the police, not the other way round.
I will be relentless in tackling anything that gets in the way of cutting
crime.

said then that I wanted to build a strong Police Force which delivered an
excellent service, as many of you will know Durham Constabulary has been
judged as the best Force in England and Wales.

Much of this success has been achieved through close working with our
communities and I remain committed to that.

This success has been achieved in spite of the savage Government cuts to our
budget. We have lost over £20m, over 300 police officers and hundreds of
police staff.

The next four years will be challenging, but with your support we can ensure
that we continue to provide a policing service of the highest quality.

During this four years I commit as follows;

To oppose the privatisation of policing. The Police service you receive must
remain publicly accountable.

I will oppose further cuts to policing, and argue for a funding formula that
delivers a fair budget.

I will ensure that we have the right mix of skills and staff, so that we have
a police service fit for the 21st century. Plans are already well developed.

I will continue to place victims at the heart of our service, ensuring the
highest quality of service to victims of crime and anti social behaviour.

I will seek to protect the vulnerable, ensuring that I continue our work
tackling domestic abuse, violence against women and girls and the protection
of victims of hate crime.

I ask for your support to allow me to seek to deliver and excellent police
service over the next four years.

Here are my top priorities for making our streets safer:

  * Safeguard frontline police
  * Cut re-offending
  * More focus on prevention

Police officers have a tough job and they need more support. Further policing
cuts will stretch their ability to keep us safe. That's why I'll campaign to
remove the unnecessary and overly expensive PCC role.* To put money into
policing rather politics.

The police we do have are too often tied up in red tape. We need to free up
the police to spend less time behind computers and more time on the streets.

I'll also make sure we do more to *stop re-offending*.

Focusing on rehabilitation and restorative justice - so people pay back to
victims and the local community - would *cut crime, save police time and
taxpayers' money.

Finally, more needs to be done to stop people becoming criminals in the first
place. We need to identify and support at-risk teenagers and young adults
before they fall into a life of crime.

I have worked as a local teacher and trustee of a charity that looks after 5,000 young people across the North East.* I know what it takes to keep people on the straight and narrow.

I'll use that experience to ensure we're doing all we can to tackle the causes
of crime in our communities.

For the last decade I've led successful local campaigns to help people across
Durham and Darlington get things done and hold politicians to account.

With your support on May 5th I'll make sure we have an effective, well-funded
police force that will help keep you and your family safe.

roads, so I will make road safety and safer driving one of my key priorities.
The consequences of each casualty extends far beyond each individual involved
to families, neighbours and whole communities. The Police need to work with
councils, the Welsh Government and others to tackle this appalling loss of
life on our roads.

Police accountability happens best at the most local level. My focus will be
to act as the catalyst to build and strengthen links between the police and
the communities they serve, and to involve local community leaders in my
decisions. The Police Commissioner needs to build links with special interest
groups, such as the farming community, vulnerable people, victims of domestic
abuse, ethnic minorities and others to understand their needs, to know how
best to prevent crime and to ensure that all people are treated fairly.

The Police Commissioner needs to rebuild the morale of our Police force after
a series of poor HMIC inspections. The Commissioner needs to take some
responsibility when things go wrong, and end the denial of poor performance
reports.

I will cut the costs of the Police Commissioners Office to invest in front
line policing and I will oppose moves to extend the powers of Police
Commissioners into other services. Police Commissioners were created without
public consent, and I will press for their replacement by elected councillors.

Living in Welshpool I understand the concern that the far flung parts of Dyfed
Powys area feel neglected. As a former member of a police authority and a
former councillor with many years' experience I believe I am well qualified to
take on this role.

We are fortunate to live in a democratic Country which allows free speech and

• I will invest in a modern CCTV infrastructure to improve the safety of our

• I will support and fund services for our youth and vulnerable groups;
• I will work with local authority departments, charities and communities;
• I will resource specialist units to deal with serious, organised and on-line

I spent 29 years of my life in the Dyfed-Powys Police, retiring in the rank of
chief superintendent in the post of national secretary of the Superintendent's
Association of England and Wales. During my police career I worked in
Carmarthen (twice), Llanelli, Fishguard, Aberystwyth, and Newtown.

I am a great supporter of the Dyfed-Powys Police and the people it serves. I
believe I understand policing and know how it can be best organised to work in
the interests of the public. My core beliefs are:-

a. That policing is at its best when it is local.

b. That cuts to front line policing and police stations should be avoided
whenever possible.

c. That where cuts have to be made they should be made to back office
functions.

d. That police officers and civilian staff need to be supported in carrying
out their often difficult and dangerous duties, not criticised, as so often
happens now.

I grew up on a farm in Powys, before becoming an
Army officer. Now I live in Carmarthenshire. I am determined to keep all our
communities safe in these tough times.

Since my election as Police and Crime Commissioner in 2012, crime and anti-
social behaviour are down 12%, more than anywhere else in Wales. I have
delivered more police officers in our towns and villages. They are spending
over 100,000 extra hours on the beat keeping you safe. I have scrapped
bureaucratic targets, so officers can do what they do best - preventing crime
and catching criminals.

I have saved your money to invest in frontline policing. Your police cost
local households 5% less than when I was elected. I have delivered safer
communities and lower household bills.

I want Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Powys to be even safer.
I want to protect our poorest and most vulnerable; when they are safe, we are
all safe.

Safer Homes. I will: increase support for victims of sexual and domestic
abuse, to help them rebuild their lives; tackle drugs and alcohol; and ensure
offenders pay their dues and put their lives in order.

Safer Work. I will: introduce a business forum, to protect businesses from the
costs of crime; improve capacity to tackle cyber crime; support fraud victims;
and prioritise road safety.

Safer Communities. I will: prioritise frontline officers, to prevent crime;
introduce Special Constables for every community that wants one; and give more
control to local people to tackle speeding.

I have the experience. I have the plan. Now I am asking for your support on
May 5th to keep us safe for the next four years.

Passmore has worked hard to ensure that the county's constabulary continues to
be one of the country's top performing rural forces.



He is committed to seeing that Suffolk is a safer place to travel around,
work, live and raise a family. Tim fought to retain the police control room in
Suffolk and said, ""More than 800 of our 1,100 officers are employed in county
policing and the preservation of our own unique culture and identity is vital
for public trust and confidence.



Under Tim's leadership, and working with Government, there has been a



  * Overall 25% cut in crime nationally since 2012
  * Major investment in roads policing to protect the safety of all road users whether they are motorists, cyclists, pedestrians or horse riders, with campaigns to target reckless speeders and drivers using their hand-held mobile phones.
  * Focus on rural crime with two new dedicated rural crime teams



He pledges to build on these successes with



  * A greater focus on the hidden crimes which wreck people's lives such as domestic violence, grooming, people trafficking and cyber crime.
  * To increase the number of operational police officers in the county as well as investing in training and kit for the constabulary
  * A drive to improve detection rates further to protect victims and deter would-be criminals

Suffolk at the PCC election is between electing a Labour commissioner who will
stand up to Tory police cuts, or a Tory commissioner who will continue to back
them.

A vote for Cath Pickles in the Police and Crime Commissioner elections is a
vote for:

  * Protection and prioritisation of front line policing: Cath opposes the drastic reduction of the number of Police Community Support Officers included in the Local Policing Plan
  * Challenge to the consensus: Suffolk needs a Police &amp; Crime Commissioner who does not take their lead from conservatives on Suffolk's district and county councils
  * Prioritising prevention of sexual and violent crime
  * A joined-up education strategy to protect EVERY child in the county from sexual abuse and exploitation
  * A joined-up strategy with health, mental health and social services to protect vulnerable and ""at-risk"" residents from crime and the fear of crime
  * An experienced senior leader, mediator and skilled communicator, capable of finding consensus and solutions

as a county. I am married and have one daughter. My further education in life
was joining the British Army at sixteen years old and taking an apprenticeship
with them at The Royal School of Military Engineering going on to become a
Combat Engineer in the Royal Engineers.

In public life I have been Mayor of Southwold, Vice Chairman of Waveney
District Council/Portfolio holder for customer service, Probation officer,
lifeboat crewman, Retained Fireman, Chairman of a regional community emergency
group plus a number of other posts.

I am passionate about public service being correctly funded and given the
resources to perform, coupled with running a budget that makes that service
very efficient.

The Police and Crime Commissioner must give a 100% commitment to the role,
ensure that there is necessary accountability at all levels of policing, its
operational focus and delivery, its record on financial performance.

The office of the PCC will have a complete open door policy both from the
public and police. At all times information will be available and any
communication acted upon appropriately and on time.

Suffolk Constabulary is considered is be one of the best Police Force in the
UK but it must be correctly funded and have a connection on the ground with
the public.

The key areas is engagement with the public on the ground, this includes
schools, inner towns and ethnic minority groups. Cybercrime is on the increase
and this must be counteracted. A 'Zero Tolerance Policy' implemented in anti-
social behaviour hotspots.

As a committed, full time UKIP Police &amp; Crime Commissioner I will always
listen and respond to your concerns.

business is predominantly London based. I have two children, Jack and Jessica.

My interests are politics, the outdoors, Scandi noir and chess.

I have no professional connections with the legal and law enforcement
agencies. I will approach the role through the belief that policing should be
democratic and impartial. I have known a number of police officers personally
and I understand their priorities.

I view the role of Police and Crime Commissioner as reflecting the priorities
and concerns of the residents of Lancashire. That must apply in both urban and
rural communities, negating the poor perception of safety and working against
all the challenges and government cuts to make safety a reality.

The police should listen to the views of residents: if elected, my role will
be to represent those views. The police are drawn from the citizenry and are
their public servants.

Cutting bureaucracy, reducing target/quota-driven policing, consistently
monitoring efficiency savings and investing in new technologies would greatly
improve morale amongst our hardworking officers.

Voting for me, as an experienced UKIP candidate (I have previously fought two
elections in Lancashire), means impartiality and belief in the democratic
process. Also I would not be claiming expenses and would donate part of my
salary to local Child Protection and Women's Refuge Charities.

I can deliver a balanced, ethical and inclusive concept that Lancashire
deserves in 2016. Older parties are burdened with central edicts whilst I
would deliver a more pragmatic independent approach based on common sense.

Vote for real modern ideas. Vote for James Barker.

Lancashire Police against budget cuts from the Conservatives both nationally
and locally.

Since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 their cuts have led to the loss
of over 900 police officers and 700 police staff in Lancashire alone. These
cuts will continue. In spite of this I have worked closely with the Chief
Constable to ensure that neighbourhood policing has been protected and we
provide an efficient and effective service. I have cut bureaucracy, ended
meaningless targets and invested in new technology. This has been recognised
by the HMIC as we are rated as 'outstanding' for efficiency and use of
resources as well as for our engagement with communities.

The government's proposed changes to the way funding is allocated would have
penalised Lancashire for our success. Their proposals would have reallocated
the equivalent of 600 Lancashire police officer jobs to other forces. I
challenged the government, launched the 'cut the cuts' campaign, signed a
letter threatening legal action and, with the support of the people of
Lancashire, made them think again. They tried this again in the annual
settlement but, again, I fought hard and won a far better outcome.

Your safety, and that of your family, is a serious business. The Conservatives
are out of touch and don't understand how devastating the cuts could have been
for the people of Lancashire. I have steered the ship through some troubled
waters and now face the future with some optimism. Lancashire is a great
county, with a great police service. With your support I aim to make it the
best force in the country.

Police and Crime Commissioners control a multi-million pound policing budget,
have the power to hire and fire Chief Constables, and have a crucial role in
ensuring the views of Lancashire residents are listened to when setting
policing priorities. The position is incredibly important.

I served in Lancashire Police for over 30 years, starting out as a bobby on
the beat, and rising through the ranks to become Superintendent. I want to use
this track record and knowledge to make sure residents have a strong and
effective force that will protect our communities.

I have a *Five Point Plan *that will make people living in Lancashire safer
and more secure.

EFFICIENT POLICING *I'll get the greatest impact for every pound spent. Visible uniform patrols go a long way to reassure the public, helping to prevent and detect crime.*

SAFER STREETS* I'll bring the focus back on crime prevention; preventing the drug dealers, the drunkenness and the anti-social behaviour that can make areas difficult to live and work in.

PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE *Young people and in particular those who are subject to sexual exploitation are extremely vulnerable. I pioneered work in this area in 2003 and I want to see it developed further.

TACKLING PREJUDICE *This takes many forms, where people are abused and attacked because of their faith, race, sexual orientation or disability. I want to do more to get to the root of the causes and create a society where everyone is respected and valued.

COMMUNITY STRENGTH *Residents who live and work in the county are key to police work. My priority is to strengthen and further develop this, particularly in areas and communities that have been distant at times from the police.

I will not just disappear into my office.""

Graham Roach's six-point plan for better policing:

  * *Local neighbourhood policing*. It's about local knowledge and an intelligence based approach to beating crime, not just walking the streets.
  * *Keeping a separate police force for Lancashire*. We'd be sidelined if we joined up with a larger less efficient force in Manchester or Merseyside would.
  * *Information to the public*. Graham will work with the Chief Constable to issue a weekly Bulletin via social media, the local press and a range of local channels.
  * *The Police Commissioner should be a watchdog* checking the police are working efficiently and appropriately, helping people to keep an eye on police performance and raise concerns. Members of the public should be involved in this work.
  * *Sufficient resources for the public* to easily access the police when they are needed, including a good non emergency (101) phone service.
  * *Fighting for resources.* Lancashire is being starved of what it needs to police the County properly. ""As Commissioner I will lead the campaign via all parties and groups for more resources from Government.""

""I will work closely with Lancashire's all party Police and Crime Panel to
scrutinise and get best value from policing. The role of the Police
Commissioner must be fully open and accountable"".

Graham Roach is an engineer, lives in Colne, was last year's Mayor of Pendle

roles together with my extensive legal knowledge allows me a unique view of

My legal background has been enhanced by experience in accountancy and I

There is no room for waste especially when budgets are tight and I guarantee a
policy of 'good housekeeping' at all times in all departments.

In listening to Surrey residents it is clear to me that my key objectives as
PCC must be:

More visible Policing*, you should recognise your local Police and I will insist that more officers including senior ranks walk the beat and get more involved with our community.

Engage with the youth of Surrey*, we have a remarkable resource in our younger people and we need more engagement, I will establish a Youth Board to develop, debate and listen.

Tackle the blight of drug and drink abuse*, my work with Drug and Alcohol Abuse Awareness in Schools has shown me exactly where the problems are and how we can fix them.

Make improved road safety a priority* by addressing the issues of anti-social driving behaviour, increasing safe road use awareness and getting tough on offenders.

Increase the number of Police Officers,* by reducing the costs associated with the PCC role I will directly recruit additional Police Officers.

with my Army Officer training to bring focus and my commercial experience to
protect you in Surrey.

I've concentrated on getting more enforcement against the bad; a Zero
Tolerance Approach, whilst also rehabilitating those offenders who can be
redeemed and at the same time improving things for victims.

We now:

Fund more police than before I started.

Reducing burglary 24%, car crime 34%.

Solve more sexual assaults and violence than before.

Protect vulnerable children and women better.

Establish uniformed council enforcement teams against anti-social behaviour ; fly tipping, litter; more are planned.

Protect children and elderly against cyber criminals.

Spend £2m+ on victims; women and minorities. Imagine children taken by mum to a refuge; next day going to their new school in the wrong uniform. It's humiliating? Now we fund their new uniforms immediately.

We rehabilitate youngsters; funding carpentry, mechanic and confidence training, taking some into prisons to meet inmates. We're keeping them out of the Court System.

Government know I fight for Surrey; they hear about it continually on the media.

I don't do what ""the party"" says. I battle for Surrey People. That's why we can now fund more cops than before I started.

Coming from a different background to the professional police and political
candidates, I will bring real life experience, knowledge and perspective to
the role of the Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner.

My immediate priorities if I get elected are:

To ensure accountability, leadership and stability within the Surrey police
chain of command, I therefore commit that my first action on being elected
would be to appoint a permanent Surrey Chief Constable with the necessary
skill sets.

I will work to formulate proposals to protect Surrey residents from the
emerging threat of internet crime. I will ensure that the review into
policing, recommended by The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC),
into the failings by Surrey Police of an online child grooming case are
implemented.

To get the best policing for the residents of Surrey requires adequate
funding; I will fight any reduction in budgets that affect the policing of
Surrey. I will halt the continual downgrading of our police service within
Surrey; the closures of police stations and centralisation of policing
resources do not benefit the vast majority of Surrey residents. The presence
of uniformed officers within our local communities needs reinvigorating. I
will ensure that privatisation of the policing services within Surrey is not
on the agenda.

my extensive professional leadership experience and my commitment as a Liberal
Democrat to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, upheld by the
rule of law.

Like many people I disagree with the idea of PCCs, but we're stuck with them
for now. That's why I'm offering a positive, balanced, community-based
alternative - not more prisons, privatisation or meaningless 'zero tolerance'
promises.

I'll focus on what actually works to *prevent* crime:

  * bringing back *community policing
  * *safeguarding victims *and vulnerable children and adults
  * working with our neighbours
  * modern police training and equipment
  * designing out crime with safer roads and more activities for young people
  * *tackling offending behaviour *through restorative justice, education and treatment for mental health and drug problems
  * more tough *community sentences* with longer prison terms for dangerous and persistent offenders.

I'll work with and challenge the police and other agencies to ensure they
address and anticipate threats to our safety, fight crime and defend victims.
I'll be fiercely independent of government, demand proper funding and
efficiencies to keep policing in public hands, and give fair, frank and
balanced reports back to the people of Surrey.

I'm a former barrister, accountant and actuary with thirty years' professional
leadership experience in both private and public sectors. I have a strong
background in criminal law and financial management and scrutiny. For ten
years I have provided strategic direction and independent oversight to other
public interest organisations on a non-political basis. As a civilian, I will
represent the public and hold Surrey's police force to account without
undermining the Chief Constable's operational independence.

best police force in the country. My plan for achieving this is:

Cutting Crime and Keeping Surrey Safe

I will ensure that Surrey Police delivers more visible policing, relentlessly
pursues criminals, improves detection rates and reduces re-offending.

Tackling Rural Crime

I will overhaul the 101 hotline, improve response times and ensure victims
have a single point of contact throughout an investigation.

Making our Town Centres Safe

Our town centres can become noisy and violent places after dark. I will work
with officers, local businesses and residents to make our town centres safe
for everyone.

Supporting Victims

Independent inspectors rated Surrey Police's support for victims as
'inadequate'. I will take urgent action to provide proper support for the
victims of crime.

Making Every Pound Count

I will fight for fair funding for Surrey Police and target resources at the
front line to drive down response times and improve detection rates.

Tackling the Threat of Terrorism

We face new threats from terrorists, home-grown and from abroad. I will review
the plan to deter and defeat terrorists in Surrey and give this top priority.

Police on the front line in Surrey are doing an excellent job, but there are
not enough police working in the community and poor leadership means that many
victims of crime are being let down, with too many crimes not being
investigated or recorded and not enough crimes being solved.

I believe that every victim of crime has the right to expect the police
service to do everything reasonably possible to investigate it and bring the
perpetrator to justice. We need a real focus on anti-social behaviour; if
'petty criminals' are not dealt with effectively they grow into tomorrow's
serious criminals.

We can achieve this by allocating more resources to front line policing,
improving 101 service response times and ensuring that those at the top of the
police service target the issues that matter most to the communities they
serve.

On election my immediate priority would be to consult widely in Surrey on a
plan to put policing at the heart of the community, working together with
victims, prisons, partnership organisations, the government and the judiciary.

I believe that my extensive background in leadership and accountability means
I have the necessary skills and experience to bring the best out of Surrey
Police, so we can all feel safer and enjoy better policing in Surrey.

Thank you for reading. I will be honoured to serve you.

could to make Cheshire a safer place in which to live and work. Under my
leadership, using my background in policing and public service - I am a former
Assistant Chief Constable for Cheshire - I believe I have delivered on my
promises.

We've seen overall crime fall to its lowest level since the 1990s* with police recorded burglaries down by 19% in the last year alone. *We've committed to more police on the streets* with 2,053 frontline officers by 2017. And we've undertaken a far-reaching review to get value for money whilst *investing in technology to put boots on the ground, not stuck behind desks.

My pledge remains simple. *I want to make Cheshire the safest county in the
country for its decent, hardworking, law-abiding citizens but I also want it
to be the most hostile county in the country for those intent on committing
crime.

My Plan for Cheshire includes:

  * More visible front-line police officers - 2,053 by March 2017
  * Enhancing community policing - officers and PCSOs where you need them most
  * Ensuring every penny of taxpayers' money is spent wisely
  * Giving officers the tools and technology they need to solve crimes
  * Developing support for victims through the Cheshire CARES service

Further details are set out in my manifesto at www.johndwyer.org.uk

I'm proud that Cheshire Constabulary has been judged, independently, as 'Outstanding'; one of the best performing in the country.* I'm determined to build on this 'Top 3' status for Cheshire in the years ahead, continuing to use my skills to manage the £192.5m police budget and deliver the safest possible county for everyone.

out and about in our communities. If something bad happens we want a quick
response, a reassuring presence and confidence that action will be taken. This
requires a strong and committed police service.

We have 18,000 fewer Police Officers now than when the Conservatives came to
government in 2010 and as I listen to local families there's a clear consensus
that these cuts threaten our safety and security. I'm determined to send that
message back to the government.

We all now know that Crime hasn't really fallen over this period, but it has
changed. It's estimated that for every recorded crime there are an additional
two unrecorded 'cyber-crimes'. Is there really a difference whether you have
lost £500 to an on-street 'pick-pocket' or to a cyber-criminal online?
Policing needs to evolve be equally effective in both cases.

Recorded crime has changed too, it's become more violent and anti-social.
Reports of violence against the person, possession of weapons and public order
offences increased by almost 20% in Cheshire alone last year.

So I say let's focus on cutting crime, not the Police. I pledge delivery of
real neighbourhood policing. I pledge to back our officers and get them back
on the streets - fighting crime and keeping us safe. I pledge to focus on the
delivery of your priorities and a police service you will be proud of. I'm
listening and reacting every day to the experiences of ordinary families
throughout Cheshire. Please visit my website to find out more and tell me your

Simply, abusers have gone behind closed doors, scammers and groomers have
moved online and criminals have globalised.

The challenge is great, our children, our young people, our bank accounts, our
pensions, our businesses, our parents and grandparents are all at risk.

I will:

  * *Launch a community led awareness campaign to 'lock our digital doors' and keep our kids safe - #CyberSafeCheshire
  * *Stand for cybersafe community led policing* and work with teachers, schools, local government, social services, fire service, health and mental health services, 3rd sector charities and organisations from Barnardos and NSPCC to Age UK and faith and volunteer organisations too
  * *Create a dedicated cybercrime unit* to tackle digital crime and support local business

More For Our Money!

The Tory government will cut £5m from Cheshire Police* in the next four years. Despite this challenge, I will:

  * Increase police '*feet on the beat*'
  * *Stop the waste of police time* resources (e.g. 'clocking on' at distant stations)
  * Use technology and data to *better police rural and urban road risks
  * *Prioritise crime prevention

Protect Those That Need Help

I will work to *protect the vulnerable*, to ensure that victims are
effectively supported and witnesses are encouraged to come forward.

A Problem Solver and Local Resident

I am an entrepreneur who has spent a lifetime solving technical and people
based challenges. *I'm a resident of Cheshire, and will represent the
interests of residents to the police, holding the police to account whilst

Whilst I have no professional connections with the legal or law enforcement

have an advantage as I understand people's concerns but do not have any
preconceptions, expectations or 'baggage' that would prevent or inhibit my
thinking regarding the implementation of democratic impartial policing
strategies.

I view the role of Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) as reflecting the
priorities and concerns of the residents of Cheshire, both town and rural
communities, negating the poor perception of safety and working against all
the challenges and government cuts to make safety a reality. The police are
also PCC constituents and their views are also important. Cutting bureaucracy,
reducing target/quota driven policing, consistently monitoring efficiency
savings and investing in new technologies would greatly improve morale amongst
our hard working officers.

Voting for a UKIP candidate is a vote for someone whose ethos and belief is in
democracy, accessibility and accountability. The older parties are burdened
with decades of indefensible ideology and policy of which we are neither
obligated to, nor inclined to support, we value commonsense.

I can deliver an impartial democratically minded PCC that Cheshire deserves
with an abundance of ambition to make Cheshire the safest and best policed
area in the country.

Vote for commonsense.

The personal qualities that I would bring to the role are excellent listening

My absolute commitment will be

  * to bring policing back to your Community,

I passionately believe that ALL crime should be reported, and made easier to
report.

If elected as West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, my primary goals
will be to

  * be visible, approachable, and alert to the communities I am serving
  * ensure new technology is adopted in a cost effective manner
  * ensure greater representation of the community on key policing issues and to improve communication between the police and people
  * guarantee transparency and scrutiny through accountability and performance reporting of the police, in compliance with an agreed Local Police &amp; Crime Plan
  * invest in locally appropriate initiatives in accordance with community issues, including Zero Tolerance

The nature of crime in the UK is constantly changing, it is essential a PCC
can ""think out of the box"" and keep abreast of new technologies and develop
approaches to improve policing.

I will give 100% commitment to the role to ensure the necessary accountability
at all levels of policing, its operational focus and delivery, and its
management and record on financial performance.

My personal guarantee to everyone who lives and/or works in the West Midlands
Police Area is that as your elected UKIP PCC I will work tirelessly to provide

My central ambition is keeping the people of the West Midlands safe and secure
by responding effectively to criminality and bringing offenders to justice.

I was born in the West Midlands and have lived here with my family for most of
my life.

I qualified as a teacher at St Peter's College, Birmingham and taught locally.
I served as an MP from 1992 - 2005 and for eight years I was a government
minister.

As a transport minister I worked closely with the police on road safety issues
and introduced seizing of uninsured vehicles and the ban on handheld mobile
phones whilst driving.

Neighbourhood policing lies at the core of keeping our communities safe.
Residents need to know officers and PCSOs in their area. Working closely with
local people our police can help create safe places to live, work and bring up
our children.

The needs of victims will always be a top priority. I will continue my Victims
Commission of experts which ensures victims get the help they need.

I want our police to have the latest technology to help them tackle crime in a
rapidly changing world.

I will continue to recruit to our force by increasing new recruits from 450 to
1000. I will ensure we recruit the very best people and that they look more
like the people of the West Midlands.

1.Protecting the frontline

I will work to increase frontline police resources to reduce victims of crime.



2\. Improving policing through technology

Equipping officers with the latest technology, giving them the tools they need
at their finger-tips. This will release hundreds of hours of extra policing in
our community.



3\. Use of resources

Police spending must focus on your priorities. Keeping police stations open,
not refurbishing Police Headquarters. I will review all spending and
prioritise the frontline, not support vanity projects.



We are served by hard working and diligent police officers and staff; Elect me

I'll *prioritise the protection of our county's young people* from
exploitation, ensuring no stone is left unturned in ensuring the grooming

communities marginalised in recent years. On day one in office I'll do

Northamptonshire deserves a strong Police and Crime Commissioner with the
right experience that listens to you, who will set out the right policing
priorities over the next four years.

As an experienced businessman and a father of three I wanted to see a Safer
and more secure Northamptonshire, I have the skills needed to oversee a £120
million pound organisation and 2,000 staff and police officers. I understand
how important the role of the Commissioner is, I believe we have a dedicated
police force and I trust them. I will do all in my power to protect, and if
possible, increase frontline police numbers.

I have been listening to the views of many residents and believe I understand
what matters most to you and your family. I will clamp down on burglary and
rural crime to ensure that victims get justice.

I will address the problem with alcohol and drug fuelled crime across our
county, as well as working to end domestic violence. I want to make sure that
our towns and villages are safe for our children and grandchildren, free from
those who wish to harm them either physically or online.

Your priorities are my priorities and I will:

• Maintain frontline policing
• Tackle rural crime
• Keep victims at the heart of justice
• Clamp down on burglary
• Increase safety for our children
• Zero tolerance to domestic violence
You deserve a hands-on Commissioner, with the right skills, vision and
experience to deliver your policing priorities. A powerful advocate, who
understands and upholds the principals of law and order in Northamptonshire.

""Savings could be made by targeting resources more effectively, i.e. Youth
Justice does excellent work but better resourcing could see them intervening
earlier and diverting young people away from crime.

""A lot of money is wasted by arresting the most vulnerable in society. Jailing
homeless veterans is self defeating. We need better partnership working to
support the vulnerable.

""I will also campaign for better policing of protests and sporting events.
Policing of such events does not always seem to be as impartial or
proportionate as it should be.

""There should be more emphasis on roads policing to reduce those killed or
seriously injured, particularly amongst young people.

""I would provide all frontline officers with 'Body Worn Videos' which would
improve evidence gathering and secure more convictions, especially in
'domestic violence' cases. It would help resolve complaints against police.

""I would also pledge not to outsource police services and ensure that
tendering for services benefits the economy of North Wales as far as is
practicable.

person best placed to hold the Chief Constable to account and to support the
work of the police to ensure effectiveness for the people of North Wales.  I
have a track record of delivery.  The recent achievement I am most proud of
was leading the work which culminated in the setting up of the North Wales
Victim Help Centre.   I began my police career on the beat in Bangor.  I was a
police officer in North Wales for over 33 years, the last nine of which were
as a Chief Superintendent.

I am* *not* *a member of a political party*. *If elected, I will represent you independent of party politics*. *I have no other allegiances - I will put the people of North Wales first every time.

My manifesto commitment is to work to ensure that people are secure in their
homes and safe in public places. I want us to work together to have the safest
communities it is possible to have.

If elected, I will: maintain a modern policing service, protect and help
vulnerable people, prioritise neighbourhood policing, encourage effective
partnerships and listen to what people tell me and act upon their concerns.

I understand policing. I want to maintain a visible police presence and the
police stations we have across North Wales.  I intend to campaign against the
risk of further cuts.

I'm putting myself forward because North Wales needs a new crime plan and a
Commissioner who supports officers on the frontline but is not part of the
establishment.

I am honest about my politics and honest about the direction I will bring to
the role:

CRACK DOWN ON ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR

I'll do everything I can to keep policing visible and bring back the local
bobby. More police and PCSOs on the streets make people feel safe and deter
crime.

WAR ON DRUGS AND TRAFFICKING BY MANCHESTER AND MERSEYSIDE GANGS

Drugs are a huge problem in many of our towns and the A55 is being used for
trafficking. I want the police to get tough on dealers who are blighting
communities.

ZERO TOLERANCE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE

Failures of different agencies to share information has meant missed
opportunities to protect vulnerable people in North Wales. I'll introduce
better training and work more closely with others to identify victims earlier.

PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM SCAMS, FRAUDSTERS AND CYBERCRIME

I'll crack down on criminals who prey on older people - whether door-to-door,
on the phone or online - and I'll create a North Wales Cyber School to help
younger people guard against being exploited online.

SMARTER ROAD SAFETY

I'll work with Community Speed Watch groups to improve road safety and I'll
review how cameras are used to best effect - I want to end the perception of
unfairness in how speed controls are enforced.

A COMMISSIONER FOR EVERYONE

I'll make services more accessible. If a distressed person wants to report a
crime in Welsh then they should get access to a fellow Welsh speaker
immediately. I'll establish a new Countryside Crime Taskforce to improve rural
policing.

privileged to live and work in North Wales.

I attended Bishop Grosseteste University Lincoln and trained as a teacher and
received my postgraduate qualification (PGCE) through Nottingham Trent

a police officer.

I returned to education and training, setting up my own training consultancy
and worked in colleges, business training departments, the corporate sector as
well as welfare to work and a range of other sectors.

Having seen the very best and the very worse of police culture I realise that
if policing by consent is to be preserved here in the UK, things must
radically change. Public image and public trust in our police are paramount
and, therefore, I believe in a zero tolerance approach to dishonesty and
corruption which seriously undermine the image and status of honest,
professional and hardworking police officers and the police service.

I would pledge to ensure that people of North Wales have a police force that
acts as public servants but command respect through professionalism, respect,
integrity and honesty through all ranks. I would:-

  * Give a 100% commitment to the role, not holding any other professional appointments/paid positions.
  * Be accessible to the public to listen to your views on policing. To be visible, approachable and alert to the community.
  * Develop a police and crime plan which addresses your community needs and priorities.
  * Ensure community representation on key issues and communication between public and police.
  * Address key public frustrations of reporting and recording all crimes.
  * Seek ways to be cost effective, innovative and efficient.

I am a senior barrister specialising in criminal law for over 25 years.

Over the last 4 years I have seen the devastating effect upon front line
police officers of the government's cuts and consequential changes in
operation.

This includes experience of the inadequate investigations criticised by
others. I am totally independent of the police.

My principles are informed by my life-long membership of the Labour Party but
my legal background means I am independent-minded.

Police officers' morale in the Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary is very low.
Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary has judged that the force ""requires
improvement"".

The latest serious case review criticises the quality of investigations into
child sexual exploitation. Violent crime is on the increase. Sexual assaults
and incidents of domestic violence have also gone up significantly.

People feel that the centralisation of police resources has removed policing from them.

After 4 chief constables in fewer than 4 years the police need stability and
leadership. Priorities have to be changed to produce better policing with
better use of experience and resources. The specialist teams disbanded over
recent years should be brought back into operation.

My pledges are clear:

  * *More officers on the beat - in rural communities, towns, on estates and in the inner cities
  * *Officers who know their community and where people know them
  * *Better technology - to allow police officers to work where they are (instead of having to return to the ever dwindling number of police stations)
  * *Body cameras for all police officers
  * *The reinstatement of specialist teams - to deal with child abuse, sex offences and domestic violence

We also need to tackle violence against women, including domestic violence,
rape and sexual abuse.

And imagine a serious debate about drug reform and decriminalisation. Wouldn't
that be something!

Public trust and confidence in the police needs to improve. If they can
protect children from harm, protect women from abuse, and deal sensibly with
substance misusers, our communities will then be much safer places in which to
live.

My top priorities to make us safe:

  * Safeguard frontline policing
  * Cut re-offending
  * Improve detection rates and provide closure for victims

Police officers have a tough job and need more support. We need to free up the
police to spend less time with bureaucracy and in offices and have more time
in our communities. A significant amount of police time is taken up with
people with mental health issues who need other help. We all need to work
together to ensure anyone experiencing a mental health crisis is not caught up
in the criminal system. We must allow our police to concentrate on solving and
stopping crime.

I'll also make sure we do more to cut re-offending.

Focusing on rehabilitation and restorative justice cuts crime, saves police
time and taxpayers' money.

In addition, more needs to be done to stop people becoming criminals in the
first place. We need to identify and support at-risk teenagers and young
adults before they fall into a life of crime.

I have been the Leader of Bath and North East Somerset Council for 9 years and
understand how to ensure large public bodies and other agencies work together
in the most effective way. As a Councillor for 25 years I know what it takes
to keep people on the straight and narrow.

I'll use that experience to ensure we're doing all we can to tackle the causes
of crime in our communities.

With your support on May 5th I'll make sure we have an effective and focussed
police force that will help keep you, your family and local community safe.

whole-heartedly. It has been a privilege to serve you.

As an independent I'm determined that party politics have no place in
policing. The Police are there to keep us safe. The Police belong to you, not
to political ideologies, nor career politicians.

I will continue to protect residents and Police from political interference,
without fear or favour - answerable only to residents of Avon and Somerset.

Policing is complex. Being your PCC for over 3 years, leading a major local
business, plus years as a magistrate, uniquely qualify me to provide
managerial skills and leadership to deliver the Police Service we all deserve.

Government cuts of £60m meant fewer police officers - with further savings to
come. Wise prioritisation, partnerships and technology is the way forward.

With the Chief Constable, tackling the rise of crimes against our most
vulnerable will be a priority.

If you choose me to be your PCC again, I shall continue to:

  * *Protect residents and police from political interference. Keeping Politics out of Policing
  * *Prevent crime so you can be safe and feel safe
  * *Listen and be your voice: working with the Chief Constable for better policing
  * *Champion Police Officers, PCSO's and Special Constables in your Neighbourhood
  * *Be a fierce advocate for victims
  * *Work with partners to make justice more accessible, faster, simpler
  * *Ensure your money is spent efficiently, effectively, wisely

MAKING A DIFFERENCE SINCE 2012

Over 25,000 victims supported by Lighthouse. *Anti-social behaviour reduced. *Reporting of domestic and sexual violent crimes increased by 50% reflecting more confidence. *All-time low in burglaries in 2014 with increased crime prevention. *Road safety: more investment in education and enforcement resulting in fewer killed/seriously injured.

place in policing.

Honesty, Integrity, Openness and Fairness

These, the principles that have stood by me, underlined the 26 years of my

Police Officer.

I am fiercely proud of the Independent role of the Police and have always been
passionate about Avon and Somerset Constabulary and its ability to deliver the

Avon and Somerset Constabulary has gone through a difficult period over the
last few years. I want to change that, to be the person that can rebuild the
reputation and service delivery in partnership with the new Chief Constable.

I will Prioritise:-

  * Putting *victims* at the heart of the criminal justice system, ensuring working in partnership the needs of the victims are prioritised.
  * Re-focus and Re-assess the needs of *Neighbourhood Policing*, listen to what you are saying and embed policing back into the communities.
  * Protect the people that protect us, be the PCC that *increases* the number of police officers and PCSO's year on year to be able to deliver the visible service we all want.
  * Deal with traditional and modern day crimes *robustly and effectively*, making best use of the criminal justice system to achieve the right outcomes.

As a Councillor from a ward with historic crime problems I know how effective
it is when Police get out of their patrol cars and engage with the community.

Since 2009, thanks to this approach, anti-social behaviour is down nearly 75%.
Visible, community based policing helps prevent crime, cuts reoffending and
reassures the public.

As my grandmother would say - 'Prevention is better than cure'.

Over the last three years police numbers have fallen, Police Stations have
closed, yet the PR team has grown by a quarter and the office of the PCC now
costs £100k more than the previous Police Authority.

The current priorities are wrong. We must protect the front line, not inflate
the back office.

With your support I vow to put the community first.

My priorities are:

  * *Putting the community at the heart of Policing

I believe in Community policing with a strong, visible presence on our
streets.

  * *Devolve and empower local policing

The Force area is too large to adopt a 'one size fits all approach'.

  * *Reducing Re-offending

I will work with the Crown Prosecution Service and Courts to speed up justice
to get criminals off our streets and before the courts.

  * *Greater support for victims of crime

Make better use of new victim support methods, such as restorative justice, to
provide a victim-led system of support.

  * *Reducing Rural Crime is a priority

I will prioritise combatting rural crime. We must tackle the perception that
this is an afterthought.

  * *Tackling anti-social behaviour and drug crime

We need to ensure that local residents and the Police are working together to
tackle these problems robustly.

  * £28.85m a year is going to private companies

across Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton and Redcar and Cleveland, using
feedback to draw up a policing plan reflecting public priorities.

Cleveland Police face extremely challenging financial circumstances. In the
past six years we have seen a real term cut of £36m (33%) in Government grants
resulting in the loss of 400 posts.

For some forces the answer to financial pressures has been to vastly reduce
Neighbourhood Policing. I am pleased to say that, following considerable work
by my Office and the Chief Constable, Neighbourhood Policing is being retained
in Cleveland.

I will continue to fight against Government cuts to policing and will continue
to have as my priorities the protection of the vulnerable and the
strengthening of Neighbourhood Policing. I welcome collaboration with other
forces, but will continue to campaign against the regionalisation of policing
and will ensure command and control remains within the county.

I have overseen major efficiency savings. For example, my office costs 30%
less than the Police Authority it replaced - that's about £350,000 a year to
be ploughed back into frontline Neighbourhood Policing.

I am the Labour candidate but as PCC  I represent all local people. Where
there are areas for improvement I will hold the Chief Constable to account in
making these improvements. I will do this whilst recognising the high level of
professionalism and integrity of the vast majority of officers  and staff. I
will continue to support these officers and speak out against those who
undermine Cleveland Police with unjustified and irresponsible attacks.

interests of all, without bias, which has been my practice during long public
service in the Magistracy.  I see it also as one of great responsibility, in
ensuring that West Mercia, with its £200 million budget and 2,000+ employees,
is administered as effectively and efficiently as possible, in the interests
of protecting and policing the community.

I have many years experience in business, both on my own account, and as a
consultant, turning around major companies, world-wide, into efficient 'fit
for purpose' operations and I believe my wide experience in leadership roles
in business, the judiciary, and sport, would be put to good use in the service
of West Mercia.

After spending some time with management, I am satisfied that, fiscally, West
Mercia is well run. Operationally, there has been demoralising comment in the
local press regarding the Peel report, but I am satisfied that the areas of
concern highlighted are already being addressed.

I am concerned that despite large sums spent on national security, we cannot
hope to guarantee safety from external threats unless we have control of our
country's borders. Locally, I have concerns that rural areas are under-
policed, whilst child and domestic crime, as well as theft and burglary, are
increasing, with detection rates for the latter falling. Cyber crime, and
online security too, are becoming increasingly important issues as society
changes.

Finally, there appears to be an assumption that the Commissioner is unable to
challenge the government on funding but I would have no such inhibitions,
political or otherwise, where a case could be made for additional funding.

I confirm this form has been prepared by me.

Birmingham University specialising in policing and criminal justice.
Throughout his career he has worked with senior police and criminal justice
officials, leading research projects for the Home Office, Ministry of Justice,
Victim Support and other national agencies, as well as for local police,
courts and probation organisations. He knows the issues and challenges for
PCCs well.

For 20 years he has also served as a local councillor - at parish, district
and county levels - and so is used to addressing individual and community
problems and holding public servants to account for the work they are paid to
do on our behalf.

His candidacy for the Office of PCC reflects his deep commitment to local
democratic control of public services and he favours devolving as much
responsibility as possible to local commanders of policing areas.

John's key goal in relation to policing and crime is to make people safer, and
feel safer. To that end, he wants to increase speed enforcement on our roads,
and the visibility of police on our streets, so strengthening their
interaction with local communities. He also wishes to see more people having
the confidence to report the crimes they suffer, particularly domestic
violence, sexual abuse and other under-reported violations.

John supports more investment in activities for young people, so addressing
issues that often lead to anti-social behaviour and crime. He also wants to
see more restorative justice schemes, with offenders making reparations to
victims and engaging in activities that address problems underlying their
misbehaviour (e.g. alcohol and drug treatment programmes, and one-to-one
mentoring schemes that support offenders in finding suitable jobs,
accommodation and in living healthier, less chaotic lives).

My top 3 priorities are to make West Mercia Police

  * **More trusted - **by listening to local people and making policing much more responsive to the priorities of local communities;

  * *More effective - *by prioritising crime prevention and tackling issues that put people at risk of offending;

  * *More efficient - *by better use of technology and partnership working.

West Mercia has been rated as one of the five worst performing police forces
in the country. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary found that
the force ""requires improvement at keeping people safe and reducing crime.""

Violent crime, sexual offences and robbery have all risen sharply in the last
year.

Local people are being let down by under-investment and a lack of strong
leadership.

We deserve better. To get that, we need a new approach.

As your next Police and Crime Commissioner I would demand *immediate
improvements* to cut crime and prevent re-offending.

I will ensure the police work more closely with local communities, meeting
local needs and tackling local priorities.

My 20 years experience as an elected councillor mean I have the skills of
listening to members of the community, championing your views and where
possible achieving your priorities.

I have lived in Worcestershire for 25 years and until recently was employed as
a senior manager in the NHS. I have built up a wealth of local knowledge and
experience of service management in the public sector.

It is time for us to have a Commissioner who will listen to local residents and act to keep them safe.

With your support on May 5th, that's exactly what I will do.

allowed to interfere as it brings a narrow agenda that could damage the front
line of policing that we all rely on and need to have trust in.

Since November 2012 I have worked for the people of West Mercia as your Deputy
Police and Crime Commissioner and have a *track record that is proven* and
open to scrutiny. Those I have worked with and the thousands I have met
publicly know that I am committed to strengthen our police services, to get
the best deal for victims of crime, use early intervention and education to
reduce offending, and ensure that people and communities take priority.

I have played a strategic role in protecting front line policing and bolstered
police numbers in West Mercia, while nationally numbers have dropped. I am
proud that confidence in our West Mercia police force is above the national
average and is rising. Victim services, key policing partnerships and local
policing have all been strengthened and I, as part of a leadership team have
been driving forward significant change to transform our policing services.

Our West Mercia police force is currently in an excellent financial position
due to prudent and careful management and plans are already in place to meet
new financial challenges that will require both *stability and continuity*.

I have demonstrated the ability to lead, have credibility in the role, and can
be trusted as a safe pair of hands to provide the *continuity* required to
reform policing and enhance the delivery of policing services.

Demand the government gives the police the funds they need

The Tories claim they have protected the Police Service. This is just not
true. West Mercia is one of the poorest funded Police areas in the country.
The government is cutting the budget by £600,000 taking officers off the beat.

I will *not* be complicit with the Tory councils across West Mercia in
cutting police services.

Put victims first

Victims must be confident that when they report a crime it will be
investigated. Over the last five years police numbers across West Mercia have
dropped by 18% and half the PCSOs have gone.

Prioritise domestic violence, anti-social behaviour, and hate crime

Reports of domestic violence across West Mercia have increased by a staggering
66%. Fewer Police and PCSOs on the beat will see an increase in anti-social
behaviour and hate crimes.

Encourage the police to work with other agencies

The Police must have the resources to work with other agencies which protect
people. Social workers, schools, faith communities and voluntary organisations
all have their part to play. Working together takes time but these crucial
relationships must be at the centre of the Police's work in West Mercia.

Educate the public about online crime and abuse

Criminals will seek out every opportunity to find victims and vulnerable
people for online scams or online abuse. The police have an important role in
educating people to stay safe online.

Vote for a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner in West Mercia and I promise I will work to deliver these priorities for you.

with no favouritism to any community. I am not satisfied that this is the case
at present, with politically correct non-crimes investigated and resources
wasted.

I am particularly concerned about the rise of extremism and the threat of
terrorism. Tough action *must* be taken against the perpetrators.

I am passionate about ending the activities of child grooming gangs. There
must be *zero tolerance* with vulnerable youngsters encouraged to come
forward in safety.

I support traditional policing methods and engagement with the people of
Bedfordshire:

  * to build trust and confidence;
  * through more local and visible policing; and
  * with more Special Constables recruited to work in their communities.

Bedfordshire Police is underfunded. I will work in partnership with private
business to raise more funding. However our money must be targeted more
efficiently.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds have previously been wasted on exit packages
for staff members. I will ensure that every single possible penny in the
police budget is spent on front-line services to provide for as many police
officers as possible.

We have several major destinations within Bedfordshire such as Luton Airport,
Luton Town, Woburn Safari Park, Whipsnade Zoo and the Motorway network.
Millions come to Bedfordshire and rely on *our* Police. We must harness
these visitors to assist in petitioning Government and with cross party
support from our local MPs, we can energetically successfully lobby for more
funding.

I will be able to do this through partnership and agreement rather than by
stirring up inter-party rivalries.

Toni Bugle as Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner means:

  * *Fairer traditional policing
  * *Protection for the vulnerable
  * *Action against child grooming gangs
  * *Safer streets
  * *Better funding and more police

I spent 20
years as a news reporter and presenter for services like ITN, TV-am and Sky,
getting to the truth of the matter and holding the authorities to account on
behalf of the public which I believe are essential skills as a Police and
Crime Commissioner. I also covered every possible stage of the Criminal
Justice system from close up, working alongside detectives and covering cases
from Magistrates' Courts to the Old Bailey. Since 2000 I have built an
international reputation as a specialist in the release of public information
in an emergency. I worked for 8 years for the Cabinet Office's National
Emergency Planning College and have advised Chief Constables, Fire Chiefs,
military leaders and the boards of some of Britain's largest companies in a
crisis, as well as speaking at the World Conference in Disaster Management.
This background means I will explain police action to the public and could
never preside over a cover-up.

I will introduce practical, common-sense solutions to work with our budget of
£100 million and to use our officers to best effect. I will work with partners
like the NHS, Fire Service and councils to share facilities where possible and
support one another so the police do take on the responsibilities of others. I
do not need an expensive Deputy or PR Agency.

I will make sure that you get a fair share of policing whether you live in the
town or country and whichever community you belong to as a Commissioner for
all.

exacerbating the historic underfunding of Bedfordshire Police. In this local
election, we need a Police and Crime Commissioner who will speak up for
Bedfordshire, fight for proper funding and work to ensure that our police are
given the resources and support to do their jobs. I have a track record of
representing others and a reputation for fighting on their behalf; I *will
be that strong voice Bedfordshire needs.

I have spent my life in public service, serving as an analyst in *military
intelligence, teaching* in Luton and Harlington and working as a *youth
worker and senior manager* across the county, working closely with our
diverse communities. I served as a local councillor in Bedford and as Unison
Branch Secretary for the county. I then worked as Youth Policy Adviser for the
Financial Services Authority, working closely with government, local
authorities and leading voluntary sector organisations. My strength is in
bringing communities and organisations together to the benefit of all, which
is why I am committed to working collaboratively with local councils, the NHS
and other public and voluntary services to make Bedfordshire a safer place for
us all to live and work.

Prevention is always better than cure. Preventing crime, reducing reoffending
and empowering victims by giving them a voice in the justice system is my
first priority and I will follow an evidence-based approach to prevent crime,
particularly violent crime, hate crime and domestic violence which ruins
lives.

Nothing is more important for the state to do than protect its citizens. My
commitment to you is to work tirelessly to do just that.

yet they have to deal with a burglary level and a terror threat like the West
Midlands, together with gun crime and serious organised crime like Merseyside.
Both of these forces are better funded and have many more police. This
scandalous situation occurs because our police are funded by government as
though we are a rural constabulary, ignoring the urban challenges faced by our
'thin blue line'. Incredibly, government funding cuts mean police strength
here has gone down rather than up since 2010.

The Chief Constable says we need at least 300 extra officers to police
Bedfordshire adequately, PCs that would enable the force to have proper
community policing in each part of the county. This is not possible with the
existing incredibly low level of police. That's why my top priority is
fighting for fairer government police funding.

My next priority is ensuring we nonetheless make the best possible use of the
resources we do have. Better use of technology, volunteering and joint working
with other police forces and the public sector, are all playing an important
role in keeping our county safe. I will continue to work hard on such
initiatives to protect front line policing strength.

Burglary and robbery are down during my tenure, whilst victim satisfaction is
up, emergency response has improved, and reporting of 'hidden harms' such as
domestic abuse, hate crimes and sexual offences have increased as victim
confidence has risen. This is a remarkable testament to the dedication of our
police and why my commitment is that I will not rest until the force is
adequately funded.

I was a serving Police Officer for 17 years and I know how the Police Service
works and what the issues faced on a daily basis by Police Officers and PCSOs
are. They put their lives at risk to protect us and deserve a Police and Crime
Commissioner who understands and supports them rather than others who see the
Police as a business to be cut.

As Leader of Cannock Chase Council for the last 5 years I have improved
services while keeping council tax increases to a minimum, running the council
efficiently and well.

As PCC I will keep policing local and keep PCs and PCSOs local too. Current
plans are for most investigations to be run from two County 'hubs'. This would
remove officers from communities, destroying neighbourhood policing.

In Staffordshire since the last PCC election, the number of Police Officers
working on the response units has been reduced to dangerously low levels.
Hundreds of officers have been lost from Staffordshire Police. Police morale
is at an all-time low and the Force has been found to be inadequate in its
treatment of vulnerable domestic violence victims.



Since 2012 Officers have been cut but there has been heavy spending on the PCC
office, with the PR machine being put ahead of Police Officers. As PCC I would
be looking to run an efficient office to reduce costs, putting money back into
local policing.



I can also confirm I have no wish to take over the Fire service regardless of
what the Tory Government would like.



Protecting local policing so the Police can protect us. If elected on May 5th,
that is what I will do.

Keep Party Politics Out of Policing

As an Independent Candidate I have no affiliation to any political party and I
am self-funded.

Upon being elected the Police and Crime Commissioner swears an *Oath of
Impartiality* before taking Office. As an Independent Candidate I am
genuinely impartial.

I describe myself as hardworking, dedicated, honest and open with a ""down to
earth"" approach. I will be easily accessible to the People of Staffordshire;
you will know me.

Having served as a frontline police officer for thirty years, I retired in
July, 2015. During this time, I worked in most areas of our County,
Staffordshire. When I first joined I was living in Werrington and had gone to
Leek College and to Staffs Poly to study law. I was first posted, in 1985 to
Burton and finished my service at Newcastle.

My first-hand experience of policing means that I know what the reality is,
NOW and what course of action to take, from Day 1.

I want to ensure fair outcomes for all and respond to the needs of the public.
In short, to be the *Voice* of the people and ensure Staffordshire Police is
operating effectively to meet these needs.

I care passionately about Our future. At the end of the day, I firmly believe
that an individual needs to know properly about policing and how to affect
change for the right reasons, not political ones.

Finally, the role of the Police and Crime Commissioner it is a question of
Integrity* and *Accountability *is key, to do the right thing is
paramount.

As Staffordshire's police and crime commissioner I have been responsible for
spending £180million of public money each year and ensuring the work of police
is effective at keeping 1.2million people living here safe.

When elected in November 2012 there was a £19.8million hole in police finances
but a firm grip on spending means budgets are in decent shape to 2020. I've
not raised, at all, the part of council tax local people pay towards policing.

I am committed to community policing. There are 1% more response and
neighbourhood officers in Stoke-on-Trent &amp; Staffordshire than when I was
elected whereas in Labour PCC areas the average is 17% fewer.

The mobile technology revolution I promised in 2013 to get officers out of
stations and on the streets is on track to deliver 250,000 extra hours of
frontline policing annually… equivalent to 110 extra officers… but at one
eighth of the cost!

Critical to the future is preparing our police to meet changing crime in an
internet enabled world. Online fraud, organised crime and the abhorrent abuse
of children are threats beyond what could have been imagined.

The strategic technology partnership I've signed with Boeing will improve the
way Staffordshire Police deal with day to day crimes and crucially prepare
them to tackle the harm caused by criminal use of technology.

See my website for more about criminal asset seizures now going back to
communities, 5700 insurance dodgers taken off Staffordshire roads, better
support through the Staffordshire Victim Gateway and how the Police Cadets I
promised are enhancing young lives.

I believe that the role of the Police and Crime Commissioner is to be able to
lead a team, control and set priorities by maximising the budget, enabling the
police to have a more visible presence on the street and better relate to
working with the local communities that they serve. I believe that by making
their presence visible they will develop links with the electorate, which I
feel has been missing for many years. If elected, I would like to go out and
engage with the constabulary in different areas, because rural and urban
policing have very different priorities. This will enable me to understand and
crucially, appreciate through dialogue what is required in the varied and
diverse areas of Staffordshire.



I am standing because I wish to help set priorities for police resources and
would like to bring some common sense to this role by consulting the public in
the community on the issues that are close to their hearts. I would also seek
to consider disposal of assets that are no longer required/underutilised in
order to assist with funding the very necessary role of front line policing.



Tackling youth anti-social behaviour (which seems to be a rising trend in
recent years) would be a foremost issue for myself, assisting in guiding them
towards joining different youth activity groups. I would also like to help the
parents of school children starting secondary school by having talks within
various schools in the Staffordshire area, providing information on the
support and resources available if they have a concern about their child's
well-being.

Whilst Paul is endorsed by the Green Party, he will answer only to the people of Staffordshire. He will appoint an independent deputy commissioner based on merit. He has a vision for better policing which is community built and YOU will be able to hold Paul and the police service to account. Community priorities highlighted to date include:

  * *Resist further budget cuts:* Staffordshire already has one the lowest number of employees per head of population. These cuts have had serious consequences.
  * *Tackle domestic abuse and violent crime:* Staffordshire's record on domestic abuse and violent crime requires improvement. He will invest in quality training of officers dealing with abuse and champion other agencies to ensure victims are supported.
  * *Abandon plans to bring the Fire Service under control of the PCC:* The services should remain separate whilst maintaining their close working relationship.
  * *Restorative Justice:* Criminals owe a debt to society but a greater debt to their victims. When victims want it, we will facilitate communication and ensure offenders make amends directly to the victim. Restorative Justice has been shown to reduce re-offending rates.
  * *Online crime strategy:* He will ensure officers have up-to-date skills, training and support to tackle this emerging and fast growing threat
  * *Drug addiction:* Refocus drug policy by getting addicts into recovery and tackling the organised criminals who profit from misery. Tackling drug issues can reduce crime substantially.
  * *Rural crime:* Bringing the protection of our countryside and wildlife front and centre
  * *Early intervention strategies:* Working with related agencies to develop effective engagement programmes for young people to prevent them getting involved in crime in the first place

Warwickshire Police. Nicola is standing in this election to guarantee that the
views of the public are at the heart of policing in Warwickshire.

She will build confidence, fairness and trust in our police force.  Nicola
will be accessible and accountable to residents and will demand the highest
standards from our police, providing a strong challenge to the Chief Constable
if performance isn't up to scratch.

Experience and Knowledge

  * Nicola is a County Councillor and as a member of the Warwickshire Police and Crime panel has, for the past three years, been scrutinizing the performance and activities of the current Police Commissioner and Police force.
  * She lives in Leamington Spa with her husband and two children.

Nicola's Top 5 Priorities

She will guarantee keeping a Warwickshire Chief Constable and will not allow a
merger with West Mercia.

""My priorities are clear. I want to put victims first. Warwickshire needs a
Police and Crime Commissioner who stands up for our residents. We need to
invest in high visibility policing and safer neighbourhood teams. They are the
bedrock of community policing. They gather intelligence and assure local
communities that their concerns will be heard.

In developing a new Police and Crime Plan for Warwickshire I will begin by
listening hard to the aspirations and priorities of our diverse communities.
That means being out in the community, meeting people and listening to them.
This will make sure our new plan reflects the needs of  Warwickshire, not the
penny pinching of the government.

Warwickshire is one of the country's smaller police authorities and has an
unusual geography. I will work to ensure that our police service will work
with their police service neighbours whilst maintaining our unique local
identity. I will encourage the use of new technology but always ensure that
our police do not lose the personal touch. As our community changes, so does
the nature of crime. Resources put into prevention, especially in such areas
as domestic abuse and cyber crime will prove cost effective in the future.

Serious cuts are being made to Warwickshire's police budget. This cannot be
defended, and I will speak out loudly about the inequity of our funding. I
will examine our budget carefully to ensure that Warwickshire receives the
high quality, efficient and effective policing it deserves.""

I was honoured to be selected to stand as the Conservative candidate in
October 2015, and have been visiting towns and villages across the county
since. I am very keen to act as a ""Champion"" for all residents and represent
their views on Policing and Crime.

I will hold the Chief Constable to account, prepare and agree a Policing Plan,
and allocate the necessary resources to ensure the Plan is carried out.

I am keen to see the numbers of Officers, PCSO's and Specials increase, so
that residents can be assured that their safety is my prime concern and
purpose. To achieve this, I have a six point plan:

  * **Ensure our Police are properly equipped, trained and motivated*

  * *Increase the numbers of Police Officers, PCSO's and Specials across Warwickshire

  * *Free the Police to fight crime, by cutting red tape and prioritising the front line

  * *Support the victims of crime by working closely with local agencies

  * *Increase Police visibility throughout the County

  * *Bring criminals to justice to protect our local communities



As PCC I will always put people before politics, and with my experience as a
Warwickshire businessman, an ex- Commanding Officer of my Regiment and 14
years of being a local councillor, I understand how both local communities and
large organisations expect unbiased advice and direction from the PCC.

I look forward to directing the Police to tackle all forms of crime in
Warwickshire, whether it be violent, fraudulent, speeding, anti-social
behaviour or any other crime being suffered, as well as putting the victim
first.

I look forward to receiving your vote on May 5th, so I can begin this
important job.

Do we need more police officers? Or do we need fewer criminals?

We need to tackle crime at its source by preventing criminal attitudes and
behaviours from developing. I will put greater focus on _prevention_ to
complement the work our police service already does in _responding_ to crimes,
securing a safer county for us all.

I'm standing as an independent candidate because party-politics has no place
in policing. Born and raised in Warwickshire, I have direct experience working
with two PCCs. Our county needs a fresh approach to tackling crime, which
starts with these eight promises I make to you:

I will *focus on preventing crimes*, not simply reacting to them.

I will *seek to break the age-crime curve*, where 18-24 year olds commit the
most crime and are the most common victims of crime.

I will *keep party-politics out of policing*.

I will *work hard to bring hidden abuse into the open* where it can be
challenged and stopped.

I will *give the people of Warwickshire a voice* in the policing and
criminal justice matters of their county.

I will *refocus drug policy* by getting addicts into recovery and tackling
the organised criminals who profit from misery.

I will *ensure cyber-crime is a priority* and that Warwickshire can face
this modern and growing threat.

I will *pursue policies based on evidence* that have been proven to work.



""Ben is dynamic, with a clear grasp of the issues facing modern policing. We
need fresh thinking to take on the challenges facing policing today. I know
that I would have greatly welcomed and would have derived great benefit from
his support, insights and knowledge when I was a Chief Constable.""

As a former senior officer in Warwickshire Police, I believe I have the
essential skills, qualities and experience needed to be your PCC. Working at
the highest levels across all five boroughs and districts I gained in-depth
knowledge and experience of policing the county.



I have always been passionate and committed to delivering a professional,
modern, innovative police force and I have a proven record of working with all
communities and organisations in crime reduction and safety.



The job of Police and Crime Commissioner is to hold the force to account on
its delivery, professionalism and results, and to scrutinise performance and
challenge when necessary.



With this in mind, my key aims are:



  * Improve the visibility of officers on our streets



  * Oversee an increase in police numbers as a main priority



  * Question the reasons for the high level of days lost through sickness



  * Ensure a swift response to emergency calls



  * Tackle rural crime, business crime and cyber-crime by supporting multi-agency initiatives



  * Ensure criminals and high crime areas are targeted by the use of technology and proactive police teams



  * Focus on initiatives supporting vulnerable victims in society



  * Work closely with communities in support of best practice crime reduction initiatives



  * Ensure young people are supported by awareness and crime diversion schemes



  * Encourage more recruits from ethnic minorities



  * Manage the budget to ensure that efficiencies are achieved from our partnership with West Mercia Police, thereby making more funds available for extra police officers



  * Develop an open and accessible engagement strategy, listen to the views of the people and hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of the force



  * Ensure Warwickshire is a professional police force with a strong identity in the partnership with West Mercia

I have served as West Yorkshire's Police &amp; Crime Commissioner since I was elected in 2012, I am standing to be re-elected on my record of delivery.

I am the only candidate in West Yorkshire with the proven ability and track
record to stand up for people across West Yorkshire providing the strong
committed leadership our police and communities need.

I made firm promises when I was elected to stand against the £140m Tory cut to
the police in West Yorkshire and to protect frontline policing.

I have delivered and with partners have protected our local Police and
Community Support Officers whilst also recruiting an extra 300 police officers
to rebuild policing numbers in West Yorkshire.

I continue to fight for more Proceeds of Crime to come back to West Yorkshire
and to invest more of this money to make sure our communities are safer and
feel safer.

I am proud that my Safer Communities Fund has now provided £1.2m new funding
to hundreds of local groups to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour and
support victims.

I pledged to reduce the cost of my office in line with Government cuts to the
police and I now have one of the lowest office costs in England &amp; Wales.

My pledges to you:

  * **Protect frontline policing *
  * **Protect Police &amp; Community Support Officers*
  * **Put more proceeds of crime back into our communities*
  * **Put victims, in particular the most vulnerable, first**
  * *Fight for a fairer funding deal for West Yorkshire

successful community is to provide a confident neighbourhood safe from crime.
Our Neighbourhood Policing Teams are the key to making us feel secure on our
streets, but they are increasingly being undermined through poor support.
Police vacancies remain unfilled while the frontline policing budget for our
area has £3 million lying there unspent. Crime has reduced in many areas, but
these neighbourhoods often then see their PCSOs reduced and sent elsewhere,
risking crime going up once more. To make matters worse, the majority of
crimes that are committed go unsolved, with the perpetrators free to offend
again.

The entourage around the Police &amp; Crime Commissioner costs over £1
million, and £26 million sits in the bank as reserves for a rainy day. It's
time to get more of this money spent: to get all our areas their fair share of
community policing; introduce more No Cold Calling Zones to protect the
vulnerable from fraud; to tackle hate crime and domestic violence head on; to
deter more from offending in the first place by catching more of those that
do.

unprecedented challenges due to sustained government cuts to policing budgets
- which will have seen them slashed by almost a third - and to threats from
extremists who seek to undermine our English values and destroy our way of
life.

However, priority must be given to traditional policing, where communities can
be secure in the knowledge that the police actually serve the local community
and have a visible presence, and can be on hand to address issues that matter
to them, such as domestic burglary, anti-social behaviour and drug crime,
which have gone largely unchallenged.

Yet, sometimes prevention is better than cure - and a special department with
its own budget will be set up so that households can apply for a grant to make
their homes more secure.

I remain steadfast to challenging religious and cultural practices which place
many women at the risk of serious harm, through forced marriages, domestic
abuse and illegal divorces. So too, to the protection of each and every child
in our community from child sexual exploitation or from institutions that
masquerade as places of education but in reality indoctrinate and teach
intolerance and to tackling political correctness which has led to 1,000's of
serious crimes swept under the carpet.

In a time of austerity, when many hundreds of families across the region rely
on food banks and cannot afford to heat their homes, I pledge a third of my
salary to go back directly into the community - elected officials can no
longer place themselves above the ordinary person - for our communities to see
real change - we really do have to ""all be in it together"".

I am asking the people of Merseyside to re-elect me as their Police
Commissioner on 5th May.

The Tories have cut police budgets hard and areas like Merseyside have lost a
huge number of jobs. Since 2010 we have lost 1600 police officers and staff
due to the Tories savage cuts. I fought hard to stop them from cutting the
Force even further and thanks to a strong public response last October, over
16,000 people signed my petition in just two weeks.

As a result of public pressure George Osborne promised to stop any further
cuts and so we can save our PCSOs, our mounted unit and neighbourhood patrols
along with a wide range of other services which were under threat. I am in no
doubt that if I had not challenged him about the cuts and if Merseysiders had
ignored my petition, we would be in grave danger of reducing the police force
to a 'blue light' only emergency service.

But there is something to celebrate. In spite of being one of the hardest hit
by Tory cuts Merseyside Police have been judged to be one of the best
performing metropolitan police forces in England by the independent police
inspectorate, HMIC.

As Merseyside Police Commissioner I will:

  * Work hard with the Chief Constable to maintain this outstanding performance
  * Build even better services for the victims of crime
  * Work hard to make our roads safer for all
  * Fight against further cuts to the police budget

With the support of the people of Merseyside I can do this and more. That is
why I am seeking re-election on May 5th 2016.

Having served as Sussex Police &amp; Crime Commissioner (PCC) since 2012, I
have the experience and proven track record to continue making a difference to
policing.

As PCC, I have held the police to account on behalf of residents, supported
victims of crime and made considerable savings to reinvest in frontline
policing.

SOME ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR

  * Opened recruitment for 100 new Police Constables, more PCSOs and issued cameras to all frontline officers
  * £20million upgrade programme for police stations
  * Established an award-winning Youth Commission, nationally recognised for outstanding public engagement
  * Encouraged the creation of dedicated business/cybercrime strategy for Sussex
  * Funding support for victims of abuse, serious sexual offences, child exploitation
  * Established the UK's first Elders Commission - giving older people a voice on policing

MY PLAN TO CONTINUE DELIVERING

If re-elected I will continue to:

  * Deliver effective neighbourhood policing to our rural communities, towns and city
  * Support victims of crime, especially our elderly and young
  * Cut crime, catch criminals and reduce reoffending
  * Protect our most vulnerable against all forms of abuse
  * Improve access to justice for local people and put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system
  * Invest in frontline policing and further improve the performance and efficiency of Sussex Police

This election really matters - the PCC is responsible for setting the £250m
budget for policing in Sussex, has the power to appoint and dismiss the Chief
Constable and must ensure residents' views are heard when setting policing
priorities.

I've travelled the length and breadth of Sussex hearing peoples' views about
what matters in local policing. We've made real progress to deliver on these
priorities - let's not put that work at risk now.

Worthing, and previously served as a West Sussex County Councillor. I live in
Worthing, and my wife recently retired after thirty years' service as a Sussex
Police officer.  I have also been a member of the Sussex Probation Board.

Like other public services, the police have suffered six years of cuts and
creeping privatisation. When services are sold off to private companies,
profit is prioritised over people.  I will fight to protect police resources
and use them efficiently to keep us safe in our homes and on our streets.

I support more emphasis on crime prevention and reducing re-offending. For
example, restorative justice helps offenders face the consequences of their
actions and gives victims a better sense of justice.

Above all, we should have a police service, not a police force: working for
local communities. Homelessness and drug use are major problems in Sussex, and
I will address them with an honest, evidence-based approach. The 'war on
drugs' has comprehensively failed, and drugs need to be seen as a health
issue, not a criminal one.  Criminalising our most vulnerable people is not
only inhumane, it simply doesn't work.

The police also must do more to tackle hate crime in Sussex - racism, domestic
abuse and LGBT abuse are not prioritised.

A Green vote on the 5th May is a vote for open, transparent policing that does
not ignore those in need. I'll work tirelessly to protect the rights, freedoms
and safety of everyone in the community.

Here are my top priorities for making our streets safer:

  * Safeguard frontline police and community support officers
  * Cut re-offending
  * More focus on preventing crime
  * More use of restorative justice and community service.

Police officers have a tough job and they need more support. *But Sussex
Police has put up with a whopping £65m in cuts over the last 5 years. Worse
still, Sussex Police faces millions more in cuts in the years ahead. *That's
the same as about 700 frontline police officers! We need to stop the cuts.
That's why I will fight to get more government money to tackle crime.

The police are too often tied up in red tape. We need to free up the police to
spend less time behind computers and more time on the streets.

I'll also make sure we do more to *stop re-offending*. Focusing on
rehabilitation and restorative justice, so people pay back victims and the
local community would *cut crime, save police time and taxpayers' money.

More should be done to stop people becoming criminals in the first place. We
need to identify and support at-risk teenagers and young adults before they
fall into a life of crime, often to support drug addiction.

I am a retired Sussex GP with more than 40 years of experience as a local councillor. I'm also a former Chairman of Sussex Police Authority.

I'll use that experience to ensure that we are* tough on crime and tough on
the causes of crime.

With your support I'll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police
force that will help keep you and your family safe.

  * Norfolk has undertaken nationally recognised work with charities and ex-service personnel organisations to prevent crime
  * Through Operations Randall and Radar *rural crime has declined year on year* with only egg theft and coursing seeing slight increases
  * There has been a focus on victims of crime with GP surgeries across the county being trained in how to spot domestic violence and sexual abuse early
  * Norfolk supports the rehabilitation of offenders coming out of prison to stop the cycle of re-offending and is looking to find employers in Norfolk to utilise their skills
  * Norfolk is the only PCC's office tasked by the Home Secretary to distribute money to charities countrywide regarding child sexual abuse
  * Norfolk Constabulary was the *first force to complete the mental health concordat* in the country
  * Norfolk remains statistically the *safest county in the country

She knows what Norfolk needs from a Police and Crime Commissioner!

Since moving to Norfolk in 1996 Jacky has been very active in the local community serving on North Norfolk District Council and the County Council.

At district level she was instrumental in setting up, and then Chairing, the
North Norfolk Housing Trust. Now Victory Housing, this has transformed the
housing of its tenants, spending millions on bringing their homes up to modern
standards, and building much needed new affordable homes.

As a County Councillor, she was Deputy Leader of the Lib Dem Group and served
on the Adult Social Services, Audit, Health Overview and Scrutiny Committees.

Current Issues

Jacky is campaigning to:

  * Increase attention on unreported crimes, e.g. domestic and sexual violence.
  * Tackle local and international gangs involved in drugs and human trafficking.
  * Take on the threat of ever-increasing cyber-crime.
  * Reduce the time wasted by the police on data handling.
  * Halt the loss of much needed PCSOs.
  * Develop joint working with neighboring counties - Suffolk and Cambridgeshire.
  * Further the use of restorative justice to reduce re-offending.

A Message from Jacky

*""I believe the key role of the Police and Crime Commissioner is to ensure that the relationship between the community and its Police Force is one of clarity, excellent communication and, above all, trust.

My knowledge of the community through my political career, my earlier
experience as a banker and management consultant and my wholesale support for
Norfolk's Constabulary makes me the ideal candidate for this important role.
Liberal Democrats believe in a fair and even handed society. Our time in
Coalition proved that - our absence from Government over the last year clearly
demonstrates it!

Please give me your support.""

with mentally disordered offenders in prison, hospital and the community to
prevent offending. I worked with many agencies including the Police,
Probation, MAPPA panels and Victim Liaison, and have experience of the
criminal justice system from many perspectives.

As a front line service the Police are often the first point of contact for
people with mental disorder. 20% of police time is currently spent dealing
with mental health issues, but there is not enough inter-agency co-operation
to make sure that vulnerable people get the help they need. If elected I would
make joined-up services for mental health a key strategic priority to free up
Police time for their core functions.

In government Labour introduced Neighbourhood Policing and provided 17,000
additional Police Officers and 16,000 PCSOs. 6 years of David Cameron has seen
those posts slashed - 18,000 posts lost and £2 million cut from Norfolk's
budget next year, while crime has risen by 12% locally. No-one wants a
politicised Police Service but only through politics can we challenge the
decisions that are devastating our Police Service.

I am standing in this election because Labour's values of equality, social
justice and co-operation should be at the heart of policing our communities.
It is the most disadvantaged and socially excluded that are disproportionately
the victims of crime and are also least able to protect themselves against its
consequences. From Magna Carta to the Human Rights Act it has been the rule of
law that limits the power of the few and protects the rights of the many.
Please support me in campaigning for a Police and Crime Commissioner who
reflects those values.

Norfolk, NR13 5EP, acting as his own Agent and accordingly I confirm that the
following statement was authored by me.

Working as a Metropolitan Police Detective for 20 years means that I have a
thorough understanding of policing issues and problems to bring to bear on my
duties as a Police and Crime Commissioner. So my intention once elected will
be to take time to learn the mechanics of a PCC's duties before exercising the
powers available to me. Then to the best of my abilities I will carry out my
duties.

Key points that I will keep uppermost in my focus will be:

  * Record ALL crime
  * Be visible, approachable and alert to the communities I serve
  * Invest in local initiatives in accordance with community concerns including support for 'Zero Tolerance'
  * Incorporate cost-effective new technology where practicable
  * Ensure more representation of the community on key policing issues and maintain regular communications between the police and the people
  * Guarantee transparency and public scrutiny through performance monitoring of the police in compliance with an agreed Local Police &amp; Crime Plan

Taxpayers rightly expect their police forces to allocate their resources,
including finance, to the most pressing needs of communities ensuring that all
are protected from crime however it might manifest itself.

I recognize that as a PCC I must ""think out of the box"" and keep abreast of
new technologies and approaches to improve policing. New technology has the
potential to deliver cost savings, meaning more money for redeployment of
uniformed Police at a community level. I want warranted officers to be doing
real police work and be visible ""on the street"" or in the local community, not
doing back office work.

  * As a businessman for most of my life and serving on the Council's Finance Committee, for some time as chairman, I can ensure that the principle of value for money will be brought to the role of PCC. When it's the taxpayer's money it is crucial that every penny is spent effectively and wisely.

used his vast experience to lead South Wales Police through a period of cuts
and major challenges.

Budget cuts have forced a reduction from 3,400 to 2,800 in police officer
numbers, but he's worked closely with the Chief Constable and his team to
build powerful alliances with the health service, with the seven local
authorities of South Wales, and with voluntary &amp; community groups to make
the communities of South Wales safe.

This deeply-embedded partnership approach is now paying dividends for the
people of South Wales, with initiatives helping to cut violence against women
and girls, to intervene quickly with young offenders and women offenders to
prevent re-offending, and a focus on protecting vulnerable people and
supporting victims. He's promoted the principles of co-operation and the
concepts of ""early innovation and prompt positive action"" as the way to make
communities safe.

In advance of this election, and building on these firm foundations, Alun has
made six pledges to the people of South Wales :

  * To make your community safer by keeping policing local
  * To cut crime &amp; disorder in co-operation with all public agencies
  * To protect the most vulnerable in our communities
  * To spend your money wisely to protect your local police team
  * To challenge the criminal justice system to meet the needs of victims
  * To play a part nationally and in tackling online threats

Alun's Police and Crime Plan 2016-2021 spells out how, if re-elected, he'll
drive work forward to deliver on those promises. That plan can be seen on the

  * *Cut costs*.  As Commissioner I would commit to taking less than the current published salary level in order to invest in putting more Police Officers on the beat.

They tell me that the problems being experienced in my community are replicated throughout the South Wales area. I commit to continuing to listen to   communities and serving   Police officers and to use that knowledge to inform the decisions that I take.

that people now take for granted:

  * Making pubs serve only in plastic cups on event days to reduce glassing;
  * Working to reduce waiting times for substance misuse treatment from 9 months to 9 weeks;
  * More police on the beat by working with South Wales Police to fund more PCSOs.

I'll bring to this role a can-do attitude, along with enthusiasm and fresh
ideas. I don't want to sit on the sidelines when I have ideas to improve our
police services. One of the first things I will do as your Commissioner is
work with colleagues from other police forces to share back-office staff and
reduce costs. Instead of wasting thousands of police hours chasing after
people whose only crime is possessing cannabis, I will target resources to
rehabilitation and treatment for those with a drug addiction. I don't think
it's fair that in many parts of Wales a black person is more likely to be
stopped and searched than a white person, and I will work to ensure this isn't
happening in our communities. I'll be the *liberal, community-focused voice

Alongside the NHS and Education, Policing is one of the most important public
services we all rely on. We hope that we will never have the need of police
support but want the reassurance that we will get the help we want in our time

Derbyshire's Police and Crime Commissioner requires extensive *experience
in policing governance, the criminal justice system, working with partner
agencies and commissioning complicated services for victims of crime. The
primary role of the PCC is to hold the Chief Constable to account to ensure
people and communities are kept safe from harm.

  * 10 years' service as a member of Derbyshire's Police Authority
  * 30 years as professional probation officer and CJ manager
  * 20 years as senior city Councillor and Cabinet Member
  * Commissioning victims services - domestic and sexual violence; hate crime

As Derbyshire's Police and Crime Commissioner I will

  * Put victims and their needs at the heart of everything that I do
  * Reject the privatisation of Police services
  * Resist further Government cuts to Derbyshire's police budget
  * Ensure proportionate deployment of police resources to areas of greatest need
  * Prioritise partnership working and make the police accountable to local people
  * Protect elderly and vulnerable people from distraction crimes and abuse

In 2012 only 14.3% of Derbyshire residents voted to elect the county's first

you and your family safe. Use your vote!

My top priorities for policing are:

  * Campaign to abolish the Police and Crime Commissioners and return to Police Authorities.
  * Campaign to legalise and regulate the sale of cannabis.
  * Reduce costs to fund more community policing.
  * Hold regular public meetings around the county, so residents can voice their concerns.
  * Oppose any moves to privatise policing.

Police officers have a difficult job, but funding in Derbyshire is cut each
year and numbers of officers reduced. I've lived in Derbyshire for twenty
years and spent many years in industry managing large budgets. I know what it
takes to cut costs. Cost savings that could pay for more officers in the
community.

Visible policing is vital to reduce the fear of crime, which can impact as
much as actual crime. I will oppose all proposals to privatise the activities
of our police. Secure communities are our priority, not opportunities for
private contractors to squeeze a profit from policing.

I don't agree with the need for Police Commissioners and will campaign for
their abolition, together with a return to Police Authorities. Police
Commissioners have too much individual influence and power. A Police
Authority, made up of elected councillors, better represents all of our views
across the county.

The legal sale and use of cannabis will free up police time. Instead of
criminalising users of cannabis, police will be able to target the real
criminals that put hard drugs on our streets. It would take money away from
the drug gangs and regulate what people buy. Regulate its production, control
its sale, and free up police time.

With your support on May 5th I'll ensure effective community policing.

available is spent on front line policing.

I will be a completely different Commissioner whose policies are guided by the
hundreds of people I have already spoken with during my campaign.

There is a real need for change that prioritises putting more officers on the
street, deals with alcohol related and domestic violence, child sexual
exploitation, human trafficking and low-level crime.

These are not just words. I will help those affected by crime and fear of
crime. I'll promote safer neighbourhoods by bringing senior police officers to
meet our communities and set priorities. Then these will become my priorities
for the police to achieve.

I will be a pro-active Commissioner - available 24/7, supporting our police to
grow into a more dynamic, forward-looking service that is more accountable,
transparent and responsive to local people.

I have a lifetime of public service - over 30 years as a firefighter, then at
Anglia Ruskin University writing their public service degree, lecturing on
policing and more recently as a Councillor.

I stand for a police service that the residents of Cambridgeshire and
Peterborough deserve. Not a service that since 2010 has been cut and
privatised.

My policy of improving communications between the police and local people will
be centre stage of my pledge to build confidence in the police, promote
community safety, reduce crime and antisocial behaviour.

I can only achieve this if you give me your mandate on the 5th May. Then l can
make it happen.

Second preferences*: If you don't vote for me as your first choice will you give me your second preference, to help me, help you?

Commissioner and I ask for your support.

It is time to take the fight to the criminals. The interests of law abiding
citizens and victims must take precedence over those of the criminals.

We must proactively go after those that make our lives a misery. I want
Cambridgeshire to be the most criminal unfriendly county in this country.

I am impatient of unnecessary bureaucracy and expect public services to run
efficiently and in the interests of the people they serve.

Illegal drug supply must be tackled head on. Turning a blind eye to drug use
sends the wrong message to our young people.

Speeding, rural crime and anti-social behavior cause misery and must be
tackled.

Political correctness must go. Our officers must have the confidence to do the
right thing and then be supported.

The 101 phone answering service must be better or crimes won't be reported.

I will cut the cost of the Commissioners office, including not having a deputy
and reviewing staff costs and numbers, and spend it on the frontline.

I want more public engagement and transparency. I want a more flexible
approach to questions from the public at meetings, more public consultations
and greater involvement of elected councillors in determining local
priorities. Where ever possible meetings will be held in public.

I served in the RAF, have run companies and been an independent member of
Cambridgeshire's Police Authority.

As Leader of Cambridgeshire County Council I drove through radical changes to
the organization improving efficiency whilst protecting frontline services.

I believe I can have a positive impact on our police force.

Other parties focus on arrests and enforcement. I will focus on reducing crime
in the first place. We can cut crime more effectively by doing what consistent
research evidence shows works best. I will therefore put more resources into:

  * preventing first-time offenders from going on to reoffend;
  * helping recently-released prisoners who want to go straight and stay out of trouble;
  * focusing attention on offenders who don't want to give up their life of crime.



Working with first-time offenders is the most effective approach. Proven
techniques, such as restorative justice which forces offenders to confront the
impact of their crimes, can turn many more people away from crime for good.
Research evidence shows this works best if done by uniformed police officers.



Accessible and effective

As your Police &amp; Crime Commissioner, I will

  * ensure the Cambridgeshire &amp; Peterborough force becomes a leader in best practice and effectiveness so we all benefit;
  * strengthen trust in the police by increasing openness and transparency;
  * set policing priorities for each urban and rural area locally and in public, with the involvement of the community and its leaders;
  * protect the principles of neighbourhood and community policing.



I grew up in the Fens, have lived and worked in Cambridge, and now live in
Queen Adelaide near Ely, so I understand the different police and crime issues
across Cambridgeshire, essential knowledge for being Commissioner.



I am a policing and security professional. I helped establish the National
Centre for Policing Excellence, and consider it a privilege to work with the
police services, alongside enthusiastic and dedicated staff.



Being Police &amp; Crime Commissioner is a more than full-time job. If elected
as your Commissioner I will undertake no other employment.
