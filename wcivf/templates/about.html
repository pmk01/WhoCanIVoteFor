# About WhoCanIVoteFor

WhoCanIVoteFor is a simple tool which allows UK voters to see lists of candidates in upcoming elections using only their postcode. 
      
All the candidate data ued in this site is collected by volunteers from council websites and other sources. If you wish to contribute, please visit **[Democracy Club Candidates](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/)**.     

Some information displayed on WhoCanIVoteFor is held by Democracy Club seperate from our candidates database. This includes 'extra' data and links such as political party contact details and manifestos, parish or town councils, or referendums.
